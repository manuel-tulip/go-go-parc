> I have been toying with proving that the power set is indeed a function, is induction a good approach? Feels to me that power sets in general call for induction

<details><summary>💭 Thinking</summary>

**Proving the functor laws**

I’m treating the power-set construction as mapping $A\mapsto\mathcal P(A)$ and $f\mapsto\mathcal P(f)$, where $\mathcal P(f)(X)=f[X]$. No induction is needed: well-definedness, identity, and composition follow by element-chasing.

**Proved the functor laws**

</details>

Induction is not the natural approach here. It is useful for constructing the power set of a **finite** set or proving $|\mathcal P(A)|=2^{|A|}$, but the functor laws hold for arbitrary sets, including infinite ones. A direct elementwise argument proves them immediately.

## Define the power-set functor

On objects, define

$$
\mathcal P(A)=\{X:X\subseteq A\}.
$$

For a function $f:A\to B$, define

$$
\mathcal P(f):\mathcal P(A)\to\mathcal P(B)
$$

by direct image:

$$
\mathcal P(f)(X)=f[X]=\{f(x):x\in X\}.
$$

This is well-defined because if $X\subseteq A$, then $f[X]\subseteq B$, so $f[X]\in\mathcal P(B)$.

The important point is that $\mathcal P(f)$ is itself a function whose:

- inputs are subsets of $A$;
- outputs are subsets of $B$.

## Identity law

For every $X\subseteq A$,

$$
\mathcal P(\operatorname{id}_A)(X)
=\operatorname{id}_A[X]
=X.
$$

Therefore

$$
\boxed{\mathcal P(\operatorname{id}_A)
=\operatorname{id}_{\mathcal P(A)}}.
$$

Your identity calculation in the notes is essentially doing exactly this. You only need to calculate it for an arbitrary $X\subseteq A$, rather than listing all subsets individually.

## Composition law

Let

$$
A\xrightarrow{f}B\xrightarrow{g}C.
$$

For every $X\subseteq A$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal P(g\circ f)(X)
  &= (g\circ f)[X] \\
  &= g[f[X]] \\
  &=\mathcal P(g)\bigl(\mathcal P(f)(X)\bigr)\\
  &=(\mathcal P(g)\circ\mathcal P(f))(X).
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the two functions agree on every $X\in\mathcal P(A)$,

$$
\boxed{\mathcal P(g\circ f)
=\mathcal P(g)\circ\mathcal P(f)}.
$$

The middle equality can be verified by an element chase:

$$
\begin{aligned}
z\in(g\circ f)[X]
&\iff \exists x\in X,\ z=g(f(x))\\
&\iff \exists y\in f[X],\ z=g(y)\\
&\iff z\in g[f[X]].
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\mathcal P:\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Set}$ is a covariant functor.

## Why induction is unnecessary

Your finite example explicitly lists every element of $\mathcal P(A)$. That works for small sets, but it hides the general argument. Instead of proving something separately for

$$
\varnothing,\{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\},
$$

take an arbitrary $X\subseteq A$. One calculation then covers every subset simultaneously, whether $A$ is finite or infinite.

Induction is appropriate for statements such as

$$
|\mathcal P(A)|=2^{|A|}
$$

when $A$ is finite. It is not needed to establish the functor laws. Technically, since there is no set of all sets, $\mathcal P$ is usually regarded as a class-level assignment, or formalized relative to a chosen universe; this foundational detail is normally suppressed in an introductory category-theory treatment.

> But isn’t induction meant for infinite sets? Is it because both A and B can both be infinite, and as such I can’t walk through both sides in an induction step? Couldn’t I then split the proof in induction on A and induction on B?

<details><summary>💭 Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying induction limits**

I’m distinguishing induction over natural numbers from reasoning about arbitrary sets. Infinite sets don’t need element-by-element induction here: proving power-set functor properties uses subset images, set extensionality, and direct verification.

**Clarified induction limits**

</details>

Induction proves an **infinite sequence of statements indexed by a well-ordered structure**, most commonly

$$
P(0),P(1),P(2),\ldots
$$

It is not a general method for “walking through” the elements of an arbitrary infinite set.

For example, ordinary induction can prove:

$$
\text{Every finite set of size }n\text{ has }2^n\text{ subsets}
$$

because there is a natural-number parameter $n$, and a set of size $n+1$ is obtained from one of size $n$ by adjoining one element.

That method does not directly cover an infinite set $A$. Starting from $\varnothing$ and adding one element at each ordinary induction step only produces finite sets:

$$
\varnothing,\quad \{a_0\},\quad \{a_0,a_1\},\quad\ldots
$$

No finite step reaches an infinite set.

## Why induction on $A$ and $B$ is not the right setup

To induct on $A$, you would need a notion such as

$$
A \longmapsto A\cup\{a\}.
$$

That gives induction over finite cardinalities. But arbitrary sets do not come with a canonical “previous set,” and infinite sets cannot generally be reached after finitely many such steps.

Inducting separately on $A$ and $B$ would therefore only prove the result for finite $A$ and $B$, unless you introduced transfinite induction and well-orderings. That would be much more machinery than the claim requires.

Also, the size of $B$ does not really matter. The proof does not need to examine every element of $B$; it only uses the fact that $f(x)\in B$ whenever $x\in A$.

## The key distinction

There are two different kinds of statements:

1. A statement about the number or construction of subsets:
   $$
   |\mathcal P(A)|=2^{|A|}
   $$
   for finite $A$. Induction is natural here.

2. A statement about what direct images do:
   $$
   (g\circ f)[X]=g[f[X]].
   $$
   This is an equality of sets, so direct elementwise reasoning is natural.

For the second statement, take an arbitrary $z$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
z\in(g\circ f)[X]
&\iff \text{there is some }x\in X\text{ such that }z=g(f(x))\\
&\iff \text{there is some }y\in f[X]\text{ such that }z=g(y)\\
&\iff z\in g[f[X]].
\end{aligned}
$$

This works identically whether $A,B,C$ are finite, countably infinite, or uncountable.

So the issue is not primarily that both $A$ and $B$ may be infinite. The deeper issue is that there is no natural induction parameter. The functor laws are uniform properties of arbitrary elements and arbitrary subsets, so an elementwise proof handles every cardinality at once.


---

> So ok, element wise is better, but let’s continue entertaining induction. A set can always potentially have a next element, so showing that something holds for an arbitrary set A and its next arbitrary element (and thus induce n new sets in B and) wouldn’t that cover infinite sets too? 
>
> Also wouldn’t we need A -f1-> B -f2-> C do both A and B ?

<details><summary>💭 Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying induction**

I’m separating two ideas: induction over finite subsets and transfinite induction over an enumeration. The latter needs limit stages and a well-ordering, but composition still requires induction only over subsets of $A$; images already lie in $B$.

**Clarified induction**

</details>

Ordinary induction still would not cover arbitrary infinite sets. Your idea becomes valid only after adding a **limit-stage rule**, which turns it into transfinite induction.

### The logical issue with “an arbitrary set and one more element”

Suppose a property $P$ satisfies

$$
P(\varnothing)
$$

and

$$
P(S)\implies P(S\cup\{s\})
\qquad(s\notin S).
$$

These conditions imply $P(S)$ for every **finite** set $S$, not every set.

A decisive counterexample is

$$
P(S):\quad S\text{ is finite}.
$$

Then:

- $\varnothing$ is finite;
- adding one element to a finite set gives another finite set;

but $P(\mathbb N)$ is false. So that induction principle cannot establish a result for all infinite sets.

Starting from $\varnothing$, the stages are

$$
\varnothing,\quad
\{a_0\},\quad
\{a_0,a_1\},\quad
\{a_0,a_1,a_2\},\ldots
$$

Every finite stage is still finite. The infinite set

$$
\{a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots\}
$$

appears at the limit stage $\omega$, not at a “next-element” stage. There is no finite $n$ whose successor is $\omega$.

Also, if by “arbitrary $A$” you mean that you assume $P(A)$ for every set $A$, then you have already assumed the entire result. In a valid induction, the induction hypothesis only applies to objects generated at earlier stages.

## Transfinite induction can implement your idea

Take a subset $X\subseteq A$, well-order its elements as

$$
X=\{x_\alpha:\alpha<\kappa\},
$$

and define

$$
X_\alpha=\{x_\beta:\beta<\alpha\}.
$$

Then there are three kinds of stages:

$$
X_0=\varnothing,
$$

$$
X_{\alpha+1}=X_\alpha\cup\{x_\alpha\},
$$

and, for a limit ordinal $\lambda$,

$$
X_\lambda=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}X_\alpha.
$$

That last clause is what ordinary induction lacks.

For

$$
A\xrightarrow{f}B\xrightarrow{g}C,
$$

define the property

$$
Q(X):\quad (g\circ f)[X]=g[f[X]].
$$

At a successor stage,

$$
\begin{aligned}
(g\circ f)[X_{\alpha+1}]
&=(g\circ f)[X_\alpha]\cup\{g(f(x_\alpha))\}\\
&=g[f[X_\alpha]]\cup\{g(f(x_\alpha))\}\\
&=g\!\left[f[X_\alpha]\cup\{f(x_\alpha)\}\right]\\
&=g[f[X_{\alpha+1}]].
\end{aligned}
$$

At a limit stage,

$$
\begin{aligned}
(g\circ f)[X_\lambda]
&=(g\circ f)\left[\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}X_\alpha\right]\\
&=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}(g\circ f)[X_\alpha]\\
&=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}g[f[X_\alpha]]\\
&=g\left[\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}f[X_\alpha]\right]\\
&=g[f[X_\lambda]].
\end{aligned}
$$

So yes: with a well-ordering and limit stages, your induction idea can be made rigorous. It is simply much heavier than the elementwise proof.

## Do we need induction on both $A$ and $B$?

No. The composition law is tested on an arbitrary input to the composite function

$$
\mathcal P(g)\circ\mathcal P(f):
\mathcal P(A)\to\mathcal P(C).
$$

An input is therefore a subset

$$
X\subseteq A.
$$

It passes through the diagram as

$$
X
\overset{\mathcal P(f)}{\longmapsto}
f[X]
\overset{\mathcal P(g)}{\longmapsto}
g[f[X]].
$$

The intermediate set $f[X]\subseteq B$ is automatically produced from $X$. There is no need to independently run through the elements or subsets of $B$.

In fact, adding one element to $X$ need not add one new element to $f[X]$. If

$$
f(x_1)=f(x_2),
$$

then adding $x_2$ after $x_1$ produces no new element in the image. This is another reason that parallel induction on $A$ and $B$ would be awkward.

You separately verify that the arrows are well-defined:

$$
X\subseteq A\implies f[X]\subseteq B,
$$

and

$$
Y\subseteq B\implies g[Y]\subseteq C.
$$

But for composition, induction—if used at all—only needs to run over the input subset $X\subseteq A$.

**Explaining transfinite induction**

I’m framing this as an ordinary induction principle extended to limit stages. Cantor developed the foundations; later mathematicians formalized the terminology. I’ll use ω, ω+1, and ω·2 to show the pattern, then rate its difficulty and applications.

**Explained transfinite induction**

</details>

The **core idea is only moderately more difficult than ordinary induction**. The unfamiliar part is not the induction itself; it is learning how **ordinal numbers** describe stages beyond all finite stages.

## The basic idea

Ordinary induction moves through

$$
0,1,2,3,\ldots
$$

using:

1. a base case;
2. a successor step $n\mapsto n+1$.

Transfinite induction continues through ordinal stages:

$$
0,1,2,\ldots,\omega,\omega+1,\omega+2,\ldots,\omega\cdot2,\ldots
$$

Here $\omega$ represents the order type of the natural numbers. It is the first stage that comes **after every finite stage**, but is not the successor of any particular natural number.

That creates a third kind of step:

1. **Base:** prove $P(0)$.
2. **Successor:** prove $P(\alpha)\Rightarrow P(\alpha+1)$.
3. **Limit:** for a limit ordinal $\lambda$, prove
   $$
   \bigl[\forall\beta<\lambda,\ P(\beta)\bigr]\Rightarrow P(\lambda).
   $$

The compact formulation is:

$$
\left(\forall\alpha\,
  \left[
    \bigl(\forall\beta<\alpha,\ P(\beta)\bigr)
    \Rightarrow P(\alpha)
  \right]\right)
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\forall\alpha\,P(\alpha).
$$

The limit case is exactly the missing ingredient in your earlier proposal about repeatedly adding a “next element.”

## A simple picture

Suppose a well-ordered set has elements

$$
a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots
$$

and define

$$
A_n=\{a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1}\}.
$$

Ordinary induction handles every $A_n$. But none of these finite stages is the entire countably infinite set. At the limit stage,

$$
A_\omega=\bigcup_{n<\omega}A_n.
$$

Then successor stages continue:

$$
A_{\omega+1}=A_\omega\cup\{a_\omega\}.
$$

So transfinite induction formalizes:

> Keep taking next steps, and whenever there is no immediate preceding step, gather everything constructed earlier.

## How difficult is it?

There are roughly three levels.

### 1. Using the principle

Once ordinals and limit stages have been introduced, basic transfinite-induction proofs are not much harder than strong induction. This is accessible in an introductory course in set theory or mathematical logic.

### 2. Understanding ordinals rigorously

This is the larger conceptual jump. One learns:

- well-orders;
- successor and limit ordinals;
- ordinal arithmetic;
- why every nonempty collection of ordinals has a least member;
- transfinite recursion;
- sometimes the role of the axiom of choice.

This is typically advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate material.

### 3. Advanced applications

In set theory, topology, logic, and abstract algebra, transfinite arguments can become highly technical. The induction principle remains simple, but the objects indexed by the ordinals may be complicated.

A useful comparison is that ordinary induction itself is elementary, while a proof using induction can still be extremely difficult.

## Induction versus recursion

These are closely related but different.

**Transfinite induction** proves statements:

$$
P(\alpha)\text{ holds for every ordinal }\alpha.
$$

**Transfinite recursion** constructs objects:

$$
X_0,\ X_1,\ldots,X_\omega,X_{\omega+1},\ldots
$$

by specifying what happens at zero, successor stages and limit stages.

Your idea of constructing a set by repeatedly adjoining another element is more precisely a proposal for **transfinite recursion**, followed by transfinite induction to prove that the construction has the desired properties.

Transfinite recursion is used, for example, to define ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation. It also defines the cumulative set hierarchy

$$
V_0=\varnothing,\qquad
V_{\alpha+1}=\mathcal P(V_\alpha),\qquad
V_\lambda=\bigcup_{\beta<\lambda}V_\beta.
$$

This hierarchy is central to modern set theory. citeturn782816search2turn782816search4

## What it is used for

### Iterating a process past all finite stages

Sometimes applying an operation finitely many times is insufficient. One continues at stage $\omega$, then possibly through further ordinal stages.

Cantor originally encountered this kind of process while repeatedly taking sets of limit points in topology. These iterations naturally led beyond finite indices. citeturn746205search5turn966048search28

### Constructing large mathematical objects

A large object can be assembled as an increasing chain:

$$
X_0\subseteq X_1\subseteq\cdots\subseteq X_\lambda\subseteq\cdots
$$

At successor stages one adds something; at limit stages one takes a union or colimit. This occurs in modern algebra, including constructions and decompositions of modules. citeturn782816search1turn782816search15

### Defining hierarchies

Examples include:

- the cumulative hierarchy $V_\alpha$;
- Gödel’s constructible hierarchy $L_\alpha$;
- Borel and descriptive-set-theoretic hierarchies;
- ranks of trees and well-founded relations;
- ordinal arithmetic.

Gödel’s constructible hierarchy, for example, is built by recursion through the ordinals, taking definable subsets at successor stages and unions at limit stages. citeturn782816search8

### Mathematical logic and proof theory

Ordinals measure the strength of formal theories. Transfinite induction up to increasingly large ordinals can express what forms of induction a theory can justify. This becomes a major subject called **ordinal analysis**.

### Replacing “continue until finished”

In finite mathematics one often says, “Repeat this operation until nothing remains.” For an infinite object, the operation might not finish after any finite number of repetitions. Ordinal indexing gives “until finished” a precise mathematical meaning.

## Who developed it?

The main credit goes to **Georg Cantor**. In his work on sets of points and derived sets, he developed the first transfinite methods during the 1880s. He introduced transfinite ordinal numbers explicitly in his 1883 work *Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre*. citeturn746205search5turn746205search2

The historical terminology is slightly more nuanced: Cantor developed and used the method, while **Felix Hausdorff** later formulated it systematically and is credited with explicitly naming “transfinite induction” in the early twentieth century. citeturn966048search0

For your power-set-functor proof, transfinite induction is legitimate after choosing a well-ordering, but it introduces ordinals, a limit-stage argument and possibly a well-ordering assumption merely to prove

$$
(g\circ f)[X]=g[f[X]],
$$

which follows from a three-line elementwise argument. It is useful as an exercise in transfinite reasoning, but deliberately excessive for that particular theorem.

**Assessing ordinal coverage**

I’m finding that the book introduces transfinite induction through well-ordered sets, but doesn’t systematically develop ordinal construction, arithmetic, or successor-limit theory. So it uses the principle without serving as a full ordinal theory text.

**Only briefly—not as a developed theory.**

In **Chapter V, §3, “Intermezzo: Zorn’s lemma,” around page 263**, Aluffi introduces induction on an arbitrary **well-ordered set** and proves the corresponding induction principle. A footnote observes that, in the context of ordinals, this is called **transfinite induction**. citeturn638557search1turn464330search2

He later actually uses “(transfinite) induction” in Chapter VI when comparing the cardinalities of bases of possibly infinite-dimensional vector spaces. citeturn866183search0

However, the book does **not systematically teach ordinal theory**. It does not substantially develop:

$$
0,1,2,\ldots,\omega,\omega+1,\ldots
$$

or give a full treatment of von Neumann ordinals, successor versus limit ordinals, ordinal arithmetic, or transfinite recursion. Aluffi works directly with **well-ordered sets**, which is sufficient for his algebraic applications.

So the answer is:

$$
\boxed{\text{Transfinite induction appears, but ordinal theory itself is mostly omitted.}}
$$

The relevant section is considerably later than your current functor discussion: Chapter V begins with irreducibility and factorization, whereas the opening chapter is the preliminary treatment of sets and categories. citeturn950450search0

Ordinals belong primarily to **set theory**, but transfinite induction is used wherever mathematics builds or analyzes objects through well-ordered stages.

## Recommended reading path

### 1. A quick, free introduction

The **Open Logic Project, *Set Theory*, chapter “Ordinals”** is a good first exposure. It develops von Neumann ordinals, their ordering, and the transfinite induction theorem directly, without assuming advanced algebra or analysis. citeturn304434search3turn304434search11

### 2. A first complete textbook

**Karel Hrbacek and Thomas Jech, *Introduction to Set Theory*** is probably the best match for your current level. It systematically covers:

- well-orders;
- ordinal numbers and arithmetic;
- transfinite induction and recursion;
- cardinal numbers and the axiom of choice.

It is used as a text for courses explicitly covering these topics. citeturn304434search5turn304434search22

A comparable alternative is **Herbert Enderton, *Elements of Set Theory***. It is concise and formal, with substantial treatment of ordinals, order types, transfinite recursion, rank, and the cumulative hierarchy. citeturn304434search0turn304434search8

### 3. A broader second course

**Ernest Schimmerling, *A Course on Set Theory*** develops the foundations while showing connections with topology, analysis, combinatorics, trees, games, ideals, and filters. citeturn304434search10turn304434search13

### 4. Advanced set theory

**Thomas Jech, *Set Theory*** is a major graduate reference. Its ordinal chapter includes well-ordering, induction and recursion, ordinal arithmetic, and well-founded relations, before moving toward forcing, large cardinals, and independence. It is substantially harder than necessary for your current question. citeturn314647search1turn314647search2

A sensible route is:

$$
\text{Open Logic chapter}
\longrightarrow
\text{Hrbacek--Jech or Enderton}
\longrightarrow
\text{Schimmerling or Jech}.
$$

## Mathematical fields that use ordinals

### Set theory and foundations

This is their native field. Ordinals index constructions such as the cumulative hierarchy

$$
V_0=\varnothing,\qquad
V_{\alpha+1}=\mathcal P(V_\alpha),\qquad
V_\lambda=\bigcup_{\beta<\lambda}V_\beta,
$$

as well as the constructible hierarchy, cardinal arithmetic, ranks of sets, and recursively defined classes.

### Topology and descriptive set theory

Repeatedly taking derived sets or forming increasingly complex Borel sets can require countably many transfinite stages. Cantor used countable ordinals in the work leading to the Cantor–Bendixson theorem, and the Borel hierarchy is indexed through countable ordinals below $\omega_1$. citeturn874584search4turn874584search7turn874584search22

The standard specialist text is **Alexander Kechris, *Classical Descriptive Set Theory***. citeturn314647search4

### Mathematical logic and proof theory

Proof theory assigns ordinal notation systems to formal theories. Roughly, the larger the transfinite induction a theory can justify, the stronger the theory is. This is called **ordinal analysis**. citeturn363114search8turn874584search16

A specialist text is **Wolfram Pohlers, *Proof Theory: An Introduction***, whose central topic is the ordinal analysis of formal systems. citeturn363114search0

### Computability theory

Computability theory studies **recursive ordinals**, admissible ordinals, and generalizations of ordinary recursion beyond $\mathbb N$. Higher recursion theory asks how computability changes when ordinal stages and transfinite structures replace ordinary finite computation. citeturn363114search3turn363114search27

### Category theory and homotopy theory

Many categorical constructions attach cells or morphisms one stage at a time and take colimits at limit stages. Quillen’s **small object argument**, for example, uses ordinal-indexed chains and transfinite compositions. citeturn874584search2turn874584search5

This is closer to the mathematical direction of *Algebra: Chapter 0*, though it appears at a much more advanced level than the elementary functor material.

## Uses in computer science

Ordinals occur mainly in **theoretical computer science, formal verification, programming-language semantics, and proof assistants**. They are usually mathematical measures used to prove something about a computation, not values that ordinary hardware manipulates.

### 1. Proving program termination

A standard termination proof assigns each program state a value in a well-founded order and proves that every program step strictly decreases that value. Natural numbers suffice for simple loops, but nested or nondeterministic processes may require tuples, multisets, or ordinal-valued ranking functions. Ordinal-valued ranking functions are an explicit technique in automated termination analysis. citeturn343405search8turn343405academia38

For example, suppose $m$ controls an outer loop and $n$ controls an inner loop. Consider

$$
\rho(m,n)=\omega m+n.
$$

When the inner loop decreases $n$,

$$
\omega m+(n-1)<\omega m+n.
$$

When the outer loop decreases $m$, the inner counter may be reset to any finite value $N$, but

$$
\omega(m-1)+N<\omega m+n.
$$

The term $\omega m$ dominates every finite reset of $n$. Thus ordinal arithmetic packages a lexicographic termination argument into a single decreasing measure.

**Franz Baader and Tobias Nipkow, *Term Rewriting and All That*** is a standard entry point for termination through well-founded reduction orderings, even when the orders are not presented explicitly as ordinals. citeturn314647search7turn314647search20

### 2. Termination and productivity in type systems

In **sized type systems**, an inductive or coinductive object receives a size index representing an ordinal bound on its depth. A recursive call must use a smaller size, while productive construction of an infinite stream must visibly make progress. This allows termination and productivity to be checked compositionally by the type system. citeturn343405search1turn343405search9turn343405search25

This work is relevant to dependently typed languages and proof assistants such as Agda and related systems.

### 3. Fixed-point semantics

Programming-language semantics frequently defines recursive programs as least or greatest fixed points. For a monotone operation $F$, its least fixed point can be approximated by

$$
x_0=\bot,
$$

$$
x_{\alpha+1}=F(x_\alpha),
$$

and at a limit stage,

$$
x_\lambda=\bigvee_{\beta<\lambda}x_\beta.
$$

When $F$ has sufficient continuity, the stages through

$$
0,1,2,\ldots,\omega
$$

often suffice. For general monotone operations on complete lattices, genuinely transfinite stages may be required. Domain theory provides the mathematical framework for these semantic constructions. citeturn746891search0turn746891search28

Useful texts are:

- **Glynn Winskel, *The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages*** for an accessible introduction; citeturn746891search2
- **Samson Abramsky and Achim Jung, “Domain Theory”** for a more extensive treatment. citeturn746891search0

### 4. Static analysis and abstract interpretation

Static analyzers compute approximations to program behavior by iterating equations over ordered abstract domains. An unrestricted iteration could form a very long or infinite ascending chain. **Widening** deliberately jumps ahead to make the analyzer converge after finitely many computational steps; conceptually, it avoids having to follow the full transfinite fixed-point construction. citeturn746891search11turn746891search15

So here ordinals explain the mathematical convergence theory, while widening supplies a practical algorithm.

### 5. Model checking and the modal $\mu$-calculus

The modal $\mu$-calculus expresses properties of transition systems using least and greatest fixed points. Its fixed-point approximants are indexed by ordinals, and a formula’s **closure ordinal** measures how many approximation stages may be needed before the fixed point is reached. citeturn343405search2turn343405search18turn343405search22

This connects ordinals with verification of reactive systems, transition systems, and temporal properties.

### 6. Formalized mathematics and theorem provers

Transfinite and well-founded recursion have been mechanized in systems such as Isabelle’s ZF environment. Such machinery supports formal definitions of recursive functions, trees, recursive data structures, and proofs in semantics and verification. citeturn304434academia44

### 7. Infinite-time computation

At the more foundational end, **infinite-time Turing machines** extend ordinary Turing-machine computation through ordinal time and specify special behavior at limit stages. This is a mathematical model of infinitary computation, not a model of physically realizable computers. citeturn363114search23

## Practical assessment

For ordinary programming and algorithms, natural-number induction and structurally recursive data types cover most needs. Ordinals become important when studying:

$$
\boxed{
\text{termination}
+\text{fixed points}
+\text{infinite structures}
+\text{proof strength}
+\text{well-founded recursion}
}
$$

Given your current work in Aluffi, the most efficient next step is the Open Logic Project’s ordinal chapter, followed by the ordinal and transfinite-recursion portions of Hrbacek–Jech. That supplies enough theory to formalize your proposed transfinite proof without requiring graduate set theory.

> What is proof theory?

<details><summary>💭 Thinking</summary>

**Explaining proof theory**

I’m defining proof theory as the study of formal proofs themselves: their syntax, structure, transformations, and limits. I’ll connect it to logic, proof systems, cut elimination, consistency, ordinals, and automated reasoning.

**Explained proof theory**

</details>

**Proof theory** is the branch of mathematical logic that studies **formal proofs as mathematical objects**.

Instead of merely asking whether a statement is true, proof theory asks:

> How can the statement be derived, which rules are used, how complicated is the derivation, and what does that reveal about the formal system?

## Formal proofs

A formal system specifies:

- a formal language;
- axioms;
- inference rules.

For example, one inference rule is modus ponens:

$$
\frac{P \qquad P\to Q}{Q}.
$$

A formal proof is a finite sequence or tree of expressions in which every step is an axiom or follows from earlier steps by an allowed inference rule.

Proof theory then treats that proof tree much as algebra treats an equation or graph theory treats a graph: it becomes an object that can be transformed and analyzed.

## Typical questions

### Consistency

Can the system prove a contradiction?

$$
\text{Can it prove both }P\text{ and }\neg P?
$$

A consistent system cannot.

### Normalization

Can every proof be transformed into a simpler or more canonical proof?

A proof may contain detours. For example, it may introduce a logical connective and then immediately eliminate it. Normalization removes such unnecessary steps.

### Cut elimination

In sequent calculus, the cut rule allows one to prove an intermediate lemma and then use it:

$$
\frac{\Gamma\vdash A \qquad A,\Delta\vdash B}
{\Gamma,\Delta\vdash B}.
$$

Cut elimination shows, for certain logical systems, that every proof using such intermediate cuts can be transformed into one without them.

This does not mean lemmas are bad in ordinary mathematics. It means that, at a foundational level, they are not always necessary for the existence of a proof.

### Strength of theories

Proof theory compares formal theories such as arithmetic or set theory:

- What kinds of induction can the theory justify?
- Which functions can it prove terminate?
- Which statements can it prove?
- Can one theory establish the consistency of another?

### Proof complexity

How long must a proof be?

Two proof systems may prove the same theorems, but one may require exponentially longer proofs than another. This is closely related to theoretical computer science and computational complexity.

## Syntax versus semantics

A useful distinction is:

- **Proof theory** studies formal derivations: syntax.
- **Model theory** studies mathematical structures in which formulas are true: semantics.

For example, given a statement $P$:

- a proof theorist asks whether $P$ can be derived using certain rules;
- a model theorist asks whether $P$ is true in particular structures.

The connection between them is expressed by results such as soundness and completeness:

$$
\text{provable} \quad\leftrightarrow\quad \text{true in every relevant model},
$$

for logical systems where completeness holds.

## Where ordinals enter

Ordinals are used to measure the complexity of recursive reductions and the strength of theories.

Suppose we repeatedly simplify a proof:

$$
\pi_0\longrightarrow\pi_1\longrightarrow\pi_2\longrightarrow\cdots
$$

To prove that this process eventually terminates, one can assign an ordinal $o(\pi)$ to each proof and show that every simplification strictly decreases it:

$$
o(\pi_{n+1})<o(\pi_n).
$$

Because ordinals are well-ordered, there cannot be an infinite strictly decreasing sequence of them. Therefore the simplification process terminates.

A theory’s **proof-theoretic ordinal** roughly measures how much transfinite induction is required to justify the theory’s proof transformations or consistency. It is not literally “the largest ordinal the theory knows”; it is a measure of the theory’s strength, dependent on how the analysis is formulated.

A standard example is that the ordinal $\varepsilon_0$ appears in the proof-theoretic analysis of Peano arithmetic.

## Main areas

**Structural proof theory** studies the architecture of proofs using systems such as natural deduction and sequent calculus.

**Ordinal analysis** measures the strength of formal theories using ordinal notation systems and transfinite induction.

**Proof complexity** studies proof lengths and computational resources.

**Type theory** connects proofs with programs. Through the Curry–Howard correspondence:

$$
\text{propositions}\leftrightarrow\text{types},
\qquad
\text{proofs}\leftrightarrow\text{programs}.
$$

Constructing a proof can therefore correspond to writing a program, and simplifying a proof can correspond to executing or simplifying that program.

## Applications in computer science

Proof theory underlies:

- proof assistants such as Lean, Coq and Agda;
- automated theorem proving;
- type checking;
- program extraction from constructive proofs;
- verification of programs and hardware;
- termination checking;
- logic programming;
- formal semantics of programming languages.

For example, proving

$$
\forall n\in\mathbb N,\ \exists m\in\mathbb N,\ R(n,m)
$$

constructively may yield an algorithm that takes $n$ and computes a corresponding $m$.

At a high level, proof theory studies the internal machinery of mathematical reasoning:

$$
\boxed{\text{What counts as a proof, how proofs behave, and what formal reasoning can accomplish.}}
$$
