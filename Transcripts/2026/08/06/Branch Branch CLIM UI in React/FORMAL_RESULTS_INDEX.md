# Formal results and proof-status index

This index is a map of the mathematical spine of *Semantic Interfaces*. It distinguishes semantic definitions, proved propositions, proof sketches, executable laws, and assumptions delegated to the host application or registry.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Introduces notation or a mathematical object; it is not a claim requiring proof. |
| **Paper proof** | A complete conventional proof at the abstraction level used in the book. |
| **Proof sketch** | Gives the decisive argument but omits routine induction or bookkeeping. |
| **Executable law** | Checked on concrete examples by the companion kernel; not a universal proof. |
| **Assumption** | A contract that the registry, predicate author, translator author, or application must establish. |
| **Mechanization target** | A theorem whose statement is suitable for a proof assistant after host-language assumptions are modeled explicitly. |

## Core semantic objects

### Tagged universe of references

For an atomic vocabulary $A$, with JavaScript representation set $V_a$ for each atom $a$, the runtime universe is a tagged disjoint sum:

$$
\Omega_R = \sum_{a\in A} V_a.
$$

A reference is written $\langle a,v\rangle$. The tag is part of the semantic value. A raw string used as a project ID and the same raw string used as a user ID are therefore different references unless an explicit identity protocol relates them.

**Location:** Chapters 5 and 10.  
**Status:** Definition.

### Type-expression grammar

The principal calculus is:

$$
\tau ::= \top
\mid \bot
\mid a
\mid \operatorname{cap}(c)
\mid \tau\lor\tau
\mid \tau\land\tau
\mid \tau\setminus\tau
\mid \operatorname{refine}(p,\theta,\tau).
$$

The public API favors base-relative difference $\tau_1\setminus\tau_2$ rather than unrestricted complement because the base states the intended universe and behaves more predictably under plugin extension.

**Location:** Chapter 10.  
**Status:** Definition.

### Denotation

Each type expression denotes a set of tagged references relative to registry snapshot $R$ and environment snapshot $e$:

$$
\llbracket\tau\rrbracket^R_e \subseteq \Omega_R.
$$

Union, intersection, and difference receive their ordinary set interpretations. A named refinement intersects its base with the truth set of a registered predicate.

**Location:** Chapters 9–11.  
**Status:** Definition.

### Semantic subtyping

Environment-local semantic subtyping is set inclusion:

$$
R,e\models \tau_1\leq\tau_2
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\llbracket\tau_1\rrbracket^R_e
\subseteq
\llbracket\tau_2\rrbracket^R_e.
$$

Global subtyping quantifies over admissible environments. The distinction matters because an environment-dependent refinement may be included in another type for one snapshot without establishing a stable registry theorem.

**Location:** Chapter 11.  
**Status:** Definition.

## Proved structural results

### Key equality induces an equivalence relation

If a deterministic semantic-identity function is total on a subset $D\subseteq\Omega_R$, equality of identity keys is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive on $D$.

**Location:** Proposition 6.1.  
**Status:** Paper proof.  
**Mechanization value:** Low difficulty; useful as the entry theorem for a formal identity model.

### Ancestor closure is a closure operator

For a reflexive-transitive nominal declaration relation, ancestor closure is extensive, monotone, and idempotent.

**Location:** Proposition 7.1.  
**Status:** Paper proof.  
**Implementation consequence:** A reference's transitive nominal facts may be precomputed and cached as a closed bitset.

### Boolean-algebra laws

The denotational model validates commutativity, associativity, idempotence, absorption, distributivity, and the expected top/bottom laws for the supported set constructors. Smart constructors in the companion implement several of these normalizations.

**Location:** Chapters 5, 7, 10, and 25.  
**Status:** Standard set proofs plus executable examples.  
**Caveat:** Syntactic normalization is not automatically a complete decision procedure for semantic equivalence.

## Matching results

### Direct matcher soundness

If direct matching succeeds with evidence $\pi$, the source reference belongs to the requested denotation:

$$
\operatorname{matchDirect}_{R,e}(r,\tau)
=\mathsf{success}(\pi)
\Longrightarrow
r\in\llbracket\tau\rrbracket^R_e.
$$

The proof proceeds by structural induction over $\tau$. Atom and capability cases rely on registry well-formedness; refinement cases rely on predicate correctness; the difference case relies on a decidable negative membership result rather than absence of a proof alone.

**Location:** Theorem 16.1.  
**Status:** Proof sketch.  
**Mechanization target:** Primary. It is the natural first substantial theorem for Lean, Coq, Agda, or Isabelle/HOL.

### Translated acceptance soundness

If full matching returns source $r$, accepted reference $r'$, requested type $\tau$, and translator path $P$, then $r'$ belongs to $\tau$, provided every edge of $P$ satisfies its declared translator contract.

The theorem intentionally does not conclude that $r$ directly belongs to $\tau$. Translation is reachability, not subtyping.

**Location:** Theorem 16.2.  
**Status:** Proof sketch plus translator-contract assumptions.  
**Mechanization target:** Primary after direct matching.

### Soundness versus completeness

The companion's `isSubtype` procedure is sound for the rules it proves but intentionally incomplete. Returning `false` can mean either “the subtype relation is false” or “this restricted proof procedure did not establish it.”

A complete decision procedure is possible only after fixing a decidable fragment and explicit assumptions about atoms, capabilities, and refinements. Arbitrary JavaScript predicates prevent a general complete procedure.

**Location:** Chapters 9, 11, 13, 20–22, and companion README.  
**Status:** Scope boundary.

## Translation results

### Least-cost path

On a finite concrete translator state graph with nonnegative costs, deterministic expansion, and the usual Dijkstra invariants, removal of a target state at least tentative cost yields a minimum-cost reachable target.

**Location:** Proposition 15.1.  
**Status:** Standard proof argument specialized to the value-dependent graph explored in one snapshot.  
**Assumptions:** Finite/bounded exploration, nonnegative costs, deterministic snapshot behavior, and contract-correct translator results.

### Translation is not subtype closure

The accepted set under translators is a reachability closure:

$$
\operatorname{Acceptable}_{R,e}(\tau)
=
\{r\mid\exists r'.\;r\Rightarrow^*_{R,e}r'
\land r'\in\llbracket\tau\rrbracket^R_e\}.
$$

This relation can be partial, effectful, asynchronous, or representation-changing. It must not be inserted into the nominal subtype order.

**Location:** Chapter 15.  
**Status:** Definition and design theorem.

## Dispatch results

### Product specificity

A method signature is a product of type expressions. Signature $S_1$ is at least as specific as $S_2$ when every component of $S_1$ is a semantic subtype of the corresponding component of $S_2$.

**Location:** Chapter 17.  
**Status:** Definition.

### Unique-maximal determinism

If applicability is deterministic and the applicable method set has exactly one maximal element under specificity, correct maximal-method dispatch returns that method independently of registration order.

**Location:** Theorem 17.1.  
**Status:** Paper proof.  
**Mechanization target:** Moderate difficulty once semantic subtyping and finite applicable-method sets are defined.

### Ambiguity is semantic information

Two applicable signatures can be incomparable. A dispatcher should report multiple maximal methods, apply a documented method-combination policy, or consult an acyclic explicit preference relation. Registration order alone is not a semantic resolution rule.

**Location:** Chapter 17.  
**Status:** Design consequence of the product partial order.

## Input-context results

### At-most-once resolution

Each input-context identifier owns one continuation and can settle it at most once. Events carrying stale identifiers have no effect on the active context.

**Location:** Invariant 18.1.  
**Status:** State-machine invariant and executable law.

### Acceptance safety

Assuming matcher soundness, translator-contract soundness, commitment-time revalidation, and stale-ID rejection, successful resolution of a request for $\tau$ returns a reference in $\llbracket\tau\rrbracket$ for the commitment snapshot.

**Location:** Theorem 18.1.  
**Status:** Proof sketch.  
**Mechanization target:** Primary after matcher soundness; it connects the pure calculus to the operational state machine.

## Linked-subject results

### Binding coherence

Views sharing one binding cell read the same subject for each role. A subject update changes the cell, not each view independently.

**Location:** Invariant 19.1.  
**Status:** State invariant and executable law.

### Subject update preserves coherence

Updating one role in the binding cell referenced by a view preserves agreement among all views sharing that cell.

**Location:** Theorem 19.1.  
**Status:** Paper proof.

### Unlink preserves the visible subject

If unlinking first clones the old binding's subject map into a fresh binding and then reassigns the view, the view's selected subjects are unchanged at the transition boundary.

**Location:** Theorem 19.2.  
**Status:** Paper proof and executable law.

## Caching result

### Membership cache soundness

Cache reuse returns the same Boolean membership answer as reevaluation when:

1. registry and expression identities agree;
2. static facts remain valid for the same semantic identity and revision;
3. every predicate's dependency fingerprint is complete;
4. any reused translator result satisfies its declared purity and dependency contract.

The decisive assumption is dependency completeness:

$$
F_p(r,e)=F_p(r',e')\land r\approx r'
\Longrightarrow
p(r,e)=p(r',e').
$$

**Location:** Theorem 22.1.  
**Status:** Proof sketch by structural induction.  
**Mechanization target:** Valuable but host-language dependent. A proof assistant can establish the generic theorem once predicate dependency completeness is represented as an assumption or supplied proof.

## Registry and host-language assumptions

The strongest runtime theorems are conditional on the following obligations.

| Obligation | Supplied by | Typical check |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal declaration safety | Registry author and TypeScript signature | Representation assignability plus setup-time graph validation |
| No nominal cycles | Registry builder | Directed-cycle detection at `freeze()` |
| Identity determinism | Descriptor author | Property tests over one snapshot |
| Refinement purity or declared volatility | Predicate author | Review, restricted DSL, or conservative no-cache policy |
| Dependency completeness | Predicate author | Mutation/property tests and revision discipline |
| Translator postcondition | Translator author | Runtime target validation and property tests |
| Translator effect metadata | Translator author | Conservative defaults; never infer purity from syntax |
| Method applicability determinism | Registry and environment discipline | Snapshot immutability and pure applicability predicates |
| Authorization | Server or trusted command boundary | Independent reauthorization; UI evidence is not authority |

These are not defects in the mathematics. They mark the interface between the formal kernel and unverified JavaScript effects.

## Executable-law coverage

The companion law suite checks concrete instances of:

1. smart-constructor Boolean identities;
2. nominal inheritance and cycle rejection;
3. inherited static capabilities;
4. positive and negative refinement evidence;
5. cross-representation semantic identity;
6. selection of a cheaper two-edge translator path over a more expensive direct path;
7. more-specific multimethod selection;
8. context-sensitive method applicability;
9. at-most-once input-context settlement;
10. binding coherence through link, update, and unlink;
11. validity-epoch invalidation.

Run it with:

```bash
cd companion
npm test
```

Executable tests exercise implementations. They do not quantify over all registries, environments, references, or type expressions and therefore do not replace proofs.

## Suggested mechanization order

1. Define finite atoms, references, and a refinement-free type grammar.
2. Define denotation and prove Boolean laws.
3. Implement direct matching and prove soundness.
4. Add nominal closure and prove atom-case soundness.
5. Add explicit negative evidence for difference.
6. Model translators as contract-carrying relations and prove translated soundness.
7. Define the input-context transition system and prove at-most-once resolution and acceptance safety.
8. Define finite method sets and prove unique-maximal determinism.
9. Add linked-subject state and coherence preservation.
10. Introduce abstract refinement predicates with dependency-completeness hypotheses.

Appendix C of the textbook gives Lean-like declarations and a longer proof-assistant roadmap.
