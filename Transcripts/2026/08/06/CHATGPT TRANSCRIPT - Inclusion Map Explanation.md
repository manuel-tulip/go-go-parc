> I don’t understand the jump from i(k(c)) = h(c) to k(c) = h(c) and why I is called inclusion

<details><summary>💭 Thinking</summary>

**Explaining inclusion**

I’m interpreting $i:E\to A$ as the inclusion map: it sends each element of $E$ to that identical element viewed inside $A$. Thus $i(k(c))=h(c)$ means $k(c)=h(c)$, with both regarded as elements of $A$.

**Explained inclusion**

</details>

Here $E$ is literally a subset of $A$:

$$
E=\{x\in A:f(x)=g(x)\}.
$$

The map

$$
i:E\hookrightarrow A
$$

is called the **inclusion map** because it simply regards an element of $E$ as an element of the larger set $A$:

$$
i(x)=x.
$$

It does not alter the element; it only changes which set we are viewing it as belonging to.

Now suppose

$$
i\circ k=h.
$$

Evaluating at $c\in C$,

$$
i(k(c))=h(c).
$$

But $i$ is inclusion, so

$$
i(k(c))=k(c)
$$

when $k(c)$ is viewed as an element of $A$. Therefore

$$
k(c)=h(c).
$$

There is a slight type distinction:

- $k(c)$ is being regarded as an element of $E$;
- $h(c)$ is initially regarded as an element of $A$.

But because $E\subseteq A$, they can be the same underlying element.

The remaining condition

$$
f\circ h=g\circ h
$$

ensures that $h(c)$ actually lies in $E$, since

$$
f(h(c))=g(h(c)).
$$

Thus the only possible definition is

$$
k(c)=h(c),
$$

with $h(c)$ now regarded as an element of $E$. This explains both existence and uniqueness of $k$.

For example, if $A=\mathbb Z$ and $E$ is the set of even integers, then $i:E\hookrightarrow\mathbb Z$ sends $4\mapsto4$. The number is unchanged; it is merely viewed as belonging to the larger set.

> So I just projects E into A, up to isomorphism? Or literally it’s only definition is i(a) = a?

In **Set**, it is literally the inclusion function

$$
i:E\to A,\qquad i(e)=e.
$$

It does not project or transform anything. It simply regards the same element $e$, originally considered as an element of $E$, as an element of $A$.

For example, if

$$
E=\{2,4,6\}\subseteq A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\},
$$

then

$$
i(2)=2,\quad i(4)=4,\quad i(6)=6.
$$

Calling it a **projection** would be misleading. A projection usually discards information, as in

$$
\pi_1:A\times B\to A,\qquad \pi_1(a,b)=a.
$$

An inclusion instead embeds a smaller set into a larger one.

The “up to isomorphism” point applies at a different level: the particular equalizer object is not uniquely determined as a literal set, but it is unique **up to a unique isomorphism**. For instance, you could use a renamed copy

$$
E'=\{x_2,x_4,x_6\}
$$

with a map $j:E'\to A$ given by $j(x_2)=2$, etc. Then $j$ is not literally an inclusion, but $(E',j)$ is isomorphic to the standard equalizer $(E,i)$.

So:

- For the construction in the book: $i(e)=e$, literally.
- For equalizers abstractly: any other equalizer is uniquely isomorphic to this one.

> Category theory

<details><summary>💭 Thinking</summary>

**Clarifying equalizers abstractly**

In category theory, an equalizer is an arrow $i:E\to A$, not necessarily a literal subset inclusion. In **Set**, it can be chosen as the subset where $f=g$, making $i$ inclusion. Generally, $i$ is monic, and equalizers are unique only up to a unique isomorphism.

**Explained equalizers abstractly**

</details>

In **abstract category theory**, $i$ is **not necessarily a literal inclusion** and the notation $i(a)=a$ may not even make sense, since objects need not have elements.

An equalizer of

$$
f,g:A\to B
$$

is an arrow

$$
i:E\to A
$$

such that

$$
f\circ i=g\circ i,
$$

with the universal property that every $h:C\to A$ satisfying $f\circ h=g\circ h$ factors uniquely as

$$
h=i\circ k
$$

for some $k:C\to E$.

The arrow $i$ is a **monomorphism**, the categorical analogue of an injective map. It should not be called a projection.

### In $\mathbf{Set}$

We can choose

$$
E=\{a\in A:f(a)=g(a)\}
$$

and then $i$ is literally

$$
i(e)=e.
$$

That is why the book concludes

$$
i(k(c))=h(c)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad k(c)=h(c).
$$

This step relies specifically on the chosen inclusion map in $\mathbf{Set}$.

### In a general category

There is no corresponding elementwise step. Instead, uniqueness is expressed through arrows:

$$
i\circ k_1=i\circ k_2
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
k_1=k_2,
$$

because every equalizer arrow $i$ is monic.

Equalizers are unique **up to unique isomorphism**: if

$$
i:E\to A
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
i':E'\to A
$$

are both equalizers, there is a unique isomorphism

$$
u:E\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}E'
$$

such that

$$
i'\circ u=i.
$$

So the distinction is:

- $i(e)=e$: true for the standard equalizer construction in $\mathbf{Set}$.
- “Unique up to isomorphism”: true for equalizers in any category.
- “Projection”: not the appropriate term; $i$ is an equalizer arrow and therefore a monomorphism.
