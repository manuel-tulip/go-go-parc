**Explaining monotonicity**

I’m interpreting the definition as saying that adding input facts can only preserve or increase derived facts. Positive rules satisfy this, while `not Archived(p)` introduces non-monotonic behavior because adding an archive fact can remove `ActiveProject(p)`.

**Explained monotonicity**

</details>

Here, **monotonicity means that adding input facts cannot cause previously derived facts to disappear**.

The possible database states form a lattice ordered by set inclusion. If $X \subseteq Y$, then $Y$ contains at least all the facts in $X$. The rule operator $F_R$ is monotone when

$$
X \subseteq Y \;\Rightarrow\; F_R(X) \subseteq F_R(Y).
$$

So, applying the rules to a larger fact set produces at least everything that applying them to the smaller set produced.

This matters because the program can be evaluated by repeatedly applying its rules:

$$
\varnothing,\quad F_R(\varnothing),\quad F_R^2(\varnothing),\ldots
$$

For monotone rules, this sequence only grows until it reaches the **least fixed point**—a state where applying the rules derives nothing new.

One important detail: the displayed condition

```text
not Archived(p)
```

is not monotone with respect to `Archived`. Adding `Archived(project-17)` could make `ActiveProject(project-17)` cease to hold. Thus, the monotonicity statement applies directly to **positive Datalog rules**. Negation must be restricted—for example through stratification—or the type system must explicitly track that the expression is non-monotone in that argument.
