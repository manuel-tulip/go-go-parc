> git as coalgebra, and how does it relate to mathematics of time

I’ll formalize Git’s commit graph as a coalgebra, then connect that model to coinduction, branching time, causality, and temporal logic.

**Modeling Git coalgebraically**

I’m framing each commit as a state exposing its snapshot, metadata, and parent list: a coalgebra for a functor like $F(X)=D\times\mathrm{List}_{\le2}(X)$. Its arrows point backward, so Git naturally models branching history.

**Connecting coalgebra and time**

I’m expanding the model by distinguishing Git’s coalgebraic history navigation from its inductive object construction. Parent links expose causal pasts, while branches and merges represent alternative and reunited histories rather than timestamps alone.

Interpreting **coalgebra** as an **$F$-coalgebra** from category theory—not a linear coalgebra with a comultiplication—Git is naturally coalgebraic because a commit can be **observed as data together with references to further states of its history**.

## 1. A commit-history coalgebra

Let:

- $C$ be the set of Git commits.
- $O$ be the observable information in a commit: its project tree, author/committer data, timestamps, and message.
- $\operatorname{List}_{\mathrm{fin}}(X)$ be finite ordered lists of elements of $X$.

Define the functor

$$
F(X)=O\times \operatorname{List}_{\mathrm{fin}}(X).
$$

A Git history then has a structure map

$$
\gamma:C\longrightarrow F(C)
$$

given by

$$
\gamma(c)=\bigl(\operatorname{observation}(c),
                \operatorname{parents}(c)\bigr).
$$

A root commit has no parents, an ordinary commit normally has one, and a merge commit has multiple parents. Actual Git commit objects contain precisely this general shape: a tree representing the snapshot, zero or more parent references, metadata, timestamps, and a message. citeturn929470view4

The coalgebra does not primarily say **how to construct** a commit. It says:

> Given a commit, what can I observe now, and where can I continue observing?

Repeatedly applying $\gamma$ unfolds the history:

```text
r ─→ a ─→ b ─────→ m
      └→ c ─→ d ──┘
```

Although causal time is drawn left-to-right here, the actual coalgebra map from $m$ exposes its parents $b$ and $d$, so it unfolds **backward into recorded time**.

Coalgebras are generally used this way to represent automata, transition systems, dynamical systems, streams, and other systems understood through observable behaviour and continuation. Bisimulation is their corresponding notion of behavioural equivalence. citeturn929470view0turn246624view0

## 2. Git contains two kinds of time

### Recorded time: unfold the past

The commit coalgebra

$$
C\to O\times\operatorname{List}_{\mathrm{fin}}(C)
$$

describes the past already recorded.

Starting from a branch tip, you repeatedly follow parent links. A branch tip therefore gives a **pointed coalgebra**:

$$
(C,\gamma,t),
$$

where $t\in C$ is the selected tip.

### Possible time: evolve the repository

A complete Git repository can instead be modeled operationally. Let $R$ be repository states and $A$ Git actions. Schematically,

$$
\delta:R\longrightarrow
\mathcal P(A\times R)
$$

says which actions and successor states are possible from the current repository.

This second coalgebra unfolds **forward into possible futures**:

- commit on the current branch,
- create another branch,
- merge,
- reset a reference,
- check out another state.

Thus:

- The **commit graph** records realized pasts.
- The **repository transition system** describes possible futures.

That distinction is central to the connection with time.

## 3. Time in Git is primarily a partial order

Define

$$
x\preceq y
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
x\text{ is an ancestor of }y.
$$

Git’s commits form a directed acyclic graph, so this ancestry relation gives a partial order. citeturn731318search0

It is not generally a total timeline. For example:

```text
       b
      /
a ───
      \
       c
```

Neither $b\preceq c$ nor $c\preceq b$. They are **concurrent in the order-theoretic sense**: the graph contains no causal evidence that one depends on the other. This does not mean they were created at exactly the same physical time.

This is closely related to Lamport’s mathematics of distributed time. In a distributed system, “happened before” naturally defines a partial order; imposing one total clock order adds information that is partly arbitrary. citeturn929470view1turn246624view1

Git similarly distinguishes graph topology from timestamps. Its history-ordering options can respect parent-child topology or primarily use commit dates, and clock skew can make timestamp order disagree with causal graph order. citeturn690008search3turn731318search5

So Git has at least two notions of time:

$$
\boxed{\text{causal time}=\text{ancestry}}
$$

and

$$
\boxed{\text{clock time}=\text{timestamp labels}}.
$$

The first is structurally fundamental; the second is metadata.

## 4. Branching time and multiple presents

A branch is not the complete history itself. It is a movable reference to a tip commit. `HEAD` normally selects one such branch reference. citeturn929470view5

Consequently, a repository can contain several legitimate “presents”:

```text
main    ─────→ m
feature ─────→ f
release ─────→ r
```

Each tip determines its own causal past.

Viewed from the root toward descendants, Git exhibits **branching future time**. Viewed from a merge commit toward its parents, it exhibits **branching past time**. A merge produces a common successor to several histories, though it is not necessarily a lattice-theoretic least upper bound.

This resembles branching-time semantics more than a single Newtonian line:

- one path represents one history,
- several paths represent alternatives,
- a merge records that several causal lines have been incorporated into a new state.

## 5. Temporal logic over Git

Suppose $P(c)$ means “commit $c$ has property $P$,” such as:

- the tests pass,
- a file exists,
- a vulnerability is absent,
- a particular change has occurred.

Using the parent relation, one can define temporal-modal operators:

$$
\Diamond^-P(c)
$$

means “$P$ holds at some immediate parent,” while

$$
\Box^-P(c)
$$

means “$P$ holds at every immediate parent.”

Their transitive versions express claims such as:

- “At some point in this history, $P$ was true.”
- “On every ancestral path, $P$ has always been true.”
- “There exists a branch on which $P$ eventually becomes true.”
- “On every possible continuation, $P$ remains invariant.”

Selecting a first-parent chain produces something like **linear temporal logic**. Keeping the complete branching graph produces CTL-style existential and universal path quantification. Coalgebraic constructions can systematically generate “next” and “previous” operators and models for temporal logics such as LTL and CTL. citeturn929470view2

## 6. Bisimulation and equivalent histories

A relation $R\subseteq C\times C$ is informally a bisimulation when, whenever $c\,R\,d$:

1. $c$ and $d$ have equivalent observations;
2. their parent histories correspond recursively.

This provides a coinductive way to say that two commits exhibit the same historical behaviour.

What counts as “the same observation” matters:

- With complete Git object data, equivalence is extremely strict.
- If observations retain only filesystem snapshots, different commits may be equivalent.
- If observations retain patches but ignore timestamps and IDs, two rebased histories might be behaviourally equivalent despite having different hashes.
- If parent order is ignored, some merges that differ in first-parent structure may become equivalent.

Coalgebra therefore separates **identity** from **observable historical behaviour**.

## 7. Git is also algebraic

There is an important qualification. Conceptually, constructing a commit has the opposite shape:

$$
\alpha:
O\times\operatorname{List}_{\mathrm{fin}}(C)
\longrightarrow C.
$$

Given commit data and parent commits, produce a new commit object. Since Git histories are finite and well-founded, they can also be treated inductively.

Thus Git has both aspects:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\textbf{Algebraic:}&
\text{construct a finite commit from data and parents},\\[2mm]
\textbf{Coalgebraic:}&
\text{observe a commit and unfold its history},\\[2mm]
\textbf{Coalgebraic dynamics:}&
\text{observe a repository’s possible next states}.
\end{array}
$$

The deepest connection to the mathematics of time is therefore:

> Git represents time not as one real-valued coordinate, but as an observable, branching, causal process. The past is a partially ordered graph, the future is a space of possible transitions, and the present is supplied by a movable reference rather than by the graph itself.
