> Can topos theory help us model “squishy proofs” that are not entirely correct, which like some kind of probabilistic logic ? I’m thinking in terms of an llm asserting something about code which can be correct up to the power of the model, and formalizing a logic around that

I’ll separate what topos theory handles well—contextual and partial truth—from what probability theory must add, then sketch a logic tailored to LLM code assertions.

**Formalizing verification**

I’m framing this with an ordered category of verification contexts and sheaf-like evidence. I’m separating semantic correctness, model-generated proofs, and calibrated confidence, while treating composition probabilistically with conservative bounds rather than naïve multiplication.

**Refining persistence**

I’m correcting a subtle point: intuitionistic truth must persist under added information, but raw model guesses may change. I’m treating observations as revisable evidence and reserving truth claims for certificates accepted by a sound external checker.

The key distinction is already clear: “locally supported,” “model-provable,” and “probably correct” are three different judgments. A useful system should preserve all three rather than collapse them into one score.

Yes—but **topos theory would model the contextual and capability-relative parts**, not probability by itself.

A useful first distinction is:

> An incorrect proof is not a proof. It is an evidence object, candidate certificate, defeasible derivation, or probabilistic assertion.

That distinction prevents model confidence from silently becoming mathematical truth.

## What a topos contributes

The internal logic of a topos generally has **generalized truth values** rather than only `true` and `false`. Its logic is usually intuitionistic, and Kripke–Joyal semantics interprets truth as validity **at a stage** or **locally over a context**. citeturn809572search3turn809572search5turn809572search1

For code reasoning, a stage could contain:

$$
c=(\text{repository version},\text{assumptions},\text{tests},
\text{dependencies},\text{tools},\text{resource budget}).
$$

Let $C$ be a category of such contexts and work in a presheaf topos

$$
\mathcal E=\mathbf{Set}^{C^{op}}.
$$

For a claim $P$, such as “this function preserves sortedness,” define an evidence presheaf

$$
\operatorname{Ev}_P(c)
   =\{\text{certificates for $P$ accepted in context $c$}\}.
$$

The truth value of $P$ at $c$ can then be represented by the collection of refinements

$$
\llbracket P\rrbracket_c
 =
 \{\,f:c'\to c\mid \operatorname{Ev}_P(c')\neq\varnothing\,\}.
$$

This is a generalized truth value: it says **under which refinements, added assumptions, or stronger verification environments the claim becomes established**. It is not a number such as $0.83$.

This is particularly useful for modular software. A property may be proved separately over modules, configurations, or dependency versions, and compatible local evidence may sometimes be glued into global evidence.

## “Correct up to the power of the model”

This is close to **realizability semantics**.

In realizability, a proposition is associated with computational objects that realize it. Realizability toposes are built from an abstract model of computation and make the computational content of constructive proofs explicit. citeturn559202view1turn449649search18

You could write

$$
M,r\Vdash P
$$

to mean:

> Agent $M$, using resource budget $r$, can produce an admissible realizer or certificate for $P$.

Here $M$ should probably not be the bare neural network. It should be the composite system

$$
M=\text{LLM}+\text{prompting strategy}+\text{tools}+\text{retrieval}
+\text{candidate checker}.
$$

This gives **model-relative provability**, not absolute truth.

If $M\preceq N$ means that $N$ can simulate all the verification abilities of $M$, then one might have

$$
M\Vdash P\quad\Longrightarrow\quad N\Vdash P.
$$

Lawvere–Tierney topologies and related modalities are relevant here because, in effective-topos settings, they can represent changes in available computational oracles and corresponding changes in truth values. citeturn559202view2turn378400academia41

That analogy should not be pushed too literally: an arbitrary LLM upgrade is unlikely to satisfy all the algebraic laws of a Lawvere–Tierney topology. But it provides a principled model for certain capability or tool-access closures.

## Where probability enters

The subobject classifier $\Omega$ of a topos should generally **not** be interpreted as a space of probabilities. A sieve or local truth value records *where and under what refinements* something holds. A probability records uncertainty under a distribution.

To add actual probabilistic uncertainty, place a probability or valuation monad $\mathcal D$ on the relevant category, or use a Markov category. Probability monads and Markov categories provide categorical models of stochastic maps, distributions, conditioning, and compositional probabilistic processes. citeturn746924search2turn559202view3

The LLM could then be represented as a stochastic map

$$
L_M :
\operatorname{Context}
\longrightarrow
\mathcal D(\operatorname{Claim}\times\operatorname{CandidateEvidence}).
$$

A belief judgment might be

$$
B^{M}_{[\ell,u]}P,
$$

meaning that, under a specified calibration distribution and context, the estimated probability that $P$ is semantically correct lies in $[\ell,u]$.

Intervals are preferable to bare point estimates because model uncertainty, distribution shift, and verifier error are rarely known precisely. Partial Markov categories are also relevant: they combine probabilistic behavior with partiality, failure, constraints, and Bayesian updating. citeturn559202view5

## A suitable combined logic

I would keep at least four modalities separate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Diamond_{M,r}P
&:\quad \text{$M$ can produce candidate evidence for $P$ within $r$},\\
B^M_{[\ell,u]}P
&:\quad \text{$M$'s calibrated belief in $P$ lies in $[\ell,u]$},\\
T_S P
&:\quad \text{$P$ has survived test/analysis suite $S$},\\
\Box_V P
&:\quad \text{trusted verifier $V$ has certified $P$}.
\end{aligned}
$$

They should obey very different rules:

$$
\Box_V P\Rightarrow P
$$

is valid only when there is a metatheoretic soundness theorem for $V$.

But neither

$$
\Diamond_{M,r}P\Rightarrow P
$$

nor

$$
B^M_{0.99}P\Rightarrow P
$$

is valid.

For a sound verifier, one should have something like

$$
\Box_V(P\to Q)\land\Box_VP\Rightarrow\Box_VQ.
$$

There is no equally simple rule for probabilistic belief. From

$$
B_\alpha P
\quad\text{and}\quad
B_\beta(P\to Q)
$$

one cannot derive a particular probability for $Q$ without assumptions about dependence and calibration.

Graded modal type theories provide existing machinery for attaching ordered or algebraic grades to judgments and tracking quantitative properties compositionally. citeturn559202view4turn746924search19 Grades could represent resource budgets, verification depth, coverage, or empirically calibrated reliability—although probability grades require more care than ordinary resource grades.

## An important subtlety about tests

“Passes all tests currently known” is not persistent truth. Adding another test may refute it.

That means raw test success should not directly inhabit the topos’s object of truth values. Instead, it should be represented as an **observation**:

$$
\operatorname{Passed}(P,S),
$$

while the stronger proposition

$$
\operatorname{Certified}_V(P)
$$

is persistent when $V$ is sound.

The probabilistic layer can update after new observations:

$$
B^M(P\mid S)
\quad\leadsto\quad
B^M(P\mid S+\text{new evidence}).
$$

This separation is essential for modeling defeasible reasoning.

## Recommended architecture

The most coherent foundation would be:

$$
\boxed{
\text{sheaf/presheaf semantics for context}
+
\text{realizability for model capability}
+
\text{graded modalities for resources}
+
\text{Markov/probability structure for belief}
}
$$

with a hard boundary between:

$$
\text{candidate evidence}
\;<\;
\text{empirically supported assertion}
\;<\;
\text{machine-checked certificate}.
$$

For implementation, a graded indexed modal logic would probably be simpler than constructing a full topos immediately. The topos would serve as its denotational semantics and explain locality, refinement, modularity, and agent-relative evidence.

A concise formulation of the research idea is:

> A squishy proof is a context-indexed, capability-relative evidence object carrying a calibrated probability grade; only a sound verification modality promotes it to a proposition in the underlying correctness logic.
