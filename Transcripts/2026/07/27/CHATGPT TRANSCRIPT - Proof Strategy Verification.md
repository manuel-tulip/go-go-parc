**Verifying the proofs**

I’m checking the handwritten arguments against the universal property of products. The main idea seems sound, but I need the exercise statements and diagram labels clearly enough to verify each equation precisely.

**Verified the proofs**

**Checking product arguments**

I’m comparing the notes with the universal property. The identity proof should use equal projections and uniqueness; the swap-map proof should define both composites and verify both identities, with the second following symmetrically.

Your answer is **essentially correct**.

The key correction: for Exercise 6, **one composite is not enough** in a general category. To prove an isomorphism, you need both

$$
k\circ h = id_{a\times b}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
h\circ k = id_{b\times a}.
$$

You may prove one and say “similarly” for the other, but do not say only one direction is needed.

A clean write-up would be:

Let

$$
p_a:a\times b\to a,\qquad p_b:a\times b\to b
$$

be the projections, and let

$$
q_b:b\times a\to b,\qquad q_a:b\times a\to a
$$

be the projections.

By the universal property of $b\times a$, there is a unique map

$$
h:a\times b\to b\times a
$$

such that

$$
q_bh=p_b,\qquad q_ah=p_a.
$$

By the universal property of $a\times b$, there is a unique map

$$
k:b\times a\to a\times b
$$

such that

$$
p_ak=q_a,\qquad p_bk=q_b.
$$

Now check the composite $k h:a\times b\to a\times b$:

$$
p_a(kh)=(p_ak)h=q_ah=p_a,
$$

and

$$
p_b(kh)=(p_bk)h=q_bh=p_b.
$$

So $kh$ has the same composites with the projections as $id_{a\times b}$. By uniqueness in the product universal property,

$$
kh=id_{a\times b}.
$$

Similarly,

$$
q_b(hk)=q_b,\qquad q_a(hk)=q_a,
$$

so

$$
hk=id_{b\times a}.
$$

Therefore

$$
a\times b\cong b\times a.
$$

For Exercise 5, your answer is correct:

$$
id_a\times id_b=id_{a\times b},
$$

because both maps $a\times b\to a\times b$ have the same composites with the two projections.

Your smaller diagram is enough. The main thing is to label the projections by their **codomain**, like $p_a,p_b,q_b,q_a$, because using only $\pi_1,\pi_2$ gets confusing when switching from $a\times b$ to $b\times a$.
