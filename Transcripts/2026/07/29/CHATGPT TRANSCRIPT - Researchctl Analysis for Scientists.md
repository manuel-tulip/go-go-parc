> Analyze https://github.com/go-go-golems/researchctl from the perspective of a scientist / new user. Does this actually address the needs on managing experiments and their artifacts and steps in a reproducible research context? Are some features just confusing and overnengineered? Are some needs not address properly? Does the approach even make sense? How well is it implemented? Could it be improved ? Could there be a fundamental shift in scripting patterns?

I’ll inspect first-use workflows, the experiment/artifact model, reproducibility guarantees, command surface, tests, code quality, and maintenance history, separating conceptual flaws from implementation defects and considering simpler architectures.

**Evaluating repo analysis steps**

I need to thoroughly inspect the repository, particularly code and documentation, using specific GitHub connectors as requested. This might involve checking files, metadata, and technical details for analysis.

**Planning repo analysis**

I’ll use the GitHub connector for metadata, then possibly clone the repo locally for detailed code inspection. Since the user mentioned implementation quality and architecture, I'll focus on that.

# Verdict

**`researchctl` has a sound core idea, but it currently solves experiment provenance better than it solves reproducible experimentation.**

Its strongest component is a local, append-only laboratory ledger: immutable-looking run records, explicit run/attempt/replicate semantics, canonical identities, verified artifacts, metrics, traces, and deterministic exports. Its weakest component is the path from a scientist’s protocol to executable steps, a fully captured computational environment, and then back from results to evidence and decisions.

For a new scientist, the answers are therefore:

| Need | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Record hypotheses, experiments, evidence, and decisions | Good, though administratively heavy |
| Define cases and replicates | Good |
| Execute and track multi-step workflows | Weak as a standalone product |
| Verify local artifacts | Strong for small and medium files |
| Recreate the computation elsewhere | Weak |
| Manage scientific design metadata | Partial |
| Analyze results | Useful for deterministic summaries, too limited for general science |
| Connect results back to claims and reports | Weak and substantially manual |
| First-use experience | Poor |
| Internal implementation discipline | Generally good, but the product is extremely young |

I reviewed current `main`, including the project schema, SQLite ledger, plan scheduler, process runner, artifact handling, analysis layer, CLI, design documents, and representative unit/integration tests. I did not execute the test suite in this environment. The repository does configure `go test ./...`, generated-file checks, and CLI smoke tests. fileciteturn97file0L11-L46

The maturity level matters. The initial implementation was merged on July 19, 2026 as a 200-commit, 762-file pull request with roughly 199,000 added lines. A major experiment-plan and analysis rewrite was merged five days later, on July 24, as another 31-commit, 186-file change. That is evidence of rapid architectural development, not of a settled scientist-facing product. fileciteturn89file0L26-L33 fileciteturn90file0L26-L33

## What is conceptually strong

### 1. The claim/evidence/decision model is scientifically sensible

The project graph explicitly distinguishes goals, questions, hypotheses, experiments, sources, evidence, decisions, reports, and completion rules. That is substantially better than treating a folder of scripts and output files as a research record. Stable IDs and validated references can make conclusions auditable. fileciteturn70file0L3-L22

The experiment schema also includes hypotheses, work packages, a config path, runbook, expected artifacts, expected metrics, thresholds, and success criteria. These are appropriate concepts for planning work before execution. fileciteturn87file0L20-L50

The important distinction it gets right is:

- a **hypothesis** is a claim;
- an **experiment** is a planned test;
- a **run** is an observation-producing execution;
- an **attempt** is a technical retry;
- a **replicate** is another scientific observation;
- **evidence** and **decisions** are interpretations made after reviewing results.

Many workflow tools cover only the execution portion. `researchctl` is trying to preserve the larger reasoning chain.

### 2. The laboratory ledger is the strongest part

The run model is unusually careful. It records:

- canonical execution specifications;
- runs and replicate indices;
- technical attempts;
- runner identities;
- events, metrics, traces, and artifacts;
- terminal attempt and run summaries;
- parent-run relationships;
- imported-run provenance;
- links from runs to project experiments. fileciteturn84file0L41-L77 fileciteturn84file0L93-L159

The SQLite schema enforces uniqueness and foreign-key relationships, while triggers prevent normal updates and deletes on the ledger tables. fileciteturn74file0L16-L163 fileciteturn74file0L165-L210

Successful attempts are also checked against required measures: a required metric must exist and have the expected value kind and unit before the attempt can close successfully. That is a meaningful integrity guarantee rather than passive logging. fileciteturn81file0L15-L44

This should be described as **append-only application storage**, however, not absolute immutability. SQLite triggers prevent ordinary mutation through the application, but they are not a cryptographic hash chain or signed audit log. Someone with direct control of the database can alter a copy or remove triggers. “Tamper-evident” would require chained hashes, signed snapshots, or external anchoring.

### 3. Artifact handling is defensive

Artifact paths are resolved under a controlled root, regular files and trees are verified, digests and sizes are computed, and verification metadata is stored with the run. fileciteturn80file0L48-L101

The process-runner tests cover path traversal, overwrite attempts, malformed frames, oversized frames, cancellation, missing handshakes, secret leakage, and false successful completion. fileciteturn65file0L84-L145 fileciteturn65file0L148-L183 fileciteturn65file0L186-L255

The terminology should be tightened: most run artifacts are **content-verified**, not generally content-addressed. The external-runner path is based on run ID, attempt ID, and filename; the digest is computed after the file is written. fileciteturn93file0L153-L185

### 4. Replicate-versus-attempt semantics are good

The plan model supports multiple cases and replicates, bounded concurrency, fail-fast behavior, deterministic declared or interleaved ordering, seeded randomization, resume, and explicit child reruns. Tests cover deterministic canonicalization, randomized schedules, concurrency limits, fail-fast behavior, and active-run recovery. fileciteturn63file0L16-L43 fileciteturn63file0L74-L113 fileciteturn64file0L21-L115

This is much better than treating every retry as another measurement and silently inflating sample size.

## The main architectural problem: three separate systems

The current product consists of three weakly connected islands:

```text
Research graph              Laboratory ledger              Analysis directory
-----------------           -----------------              ------------------
hypotheses                   specifications                 dataset.json
planned experiments   --->   runs and attempts       --->   tables / charts
expected artifacts           actual artifacts               report.md
expected metrics             actual metrics                 result.json
decisions                    traces and events
```

The arrows are not sufficiently automatic.

The project graph contains expected outputs and success criteria, but the generic completion rule mostly checks manually maintained graph state. It checks that an experiment is marked done, has hypotheses and success criteria, and has non-empty expected artifact or metric names. Its only deeper result check is a special case for `codesign_run_manifest` evidence. fileciteturn88file0L85-L116 fileciteturn88file0L162-L197

The analysis command opens the laboratory read-only, builds a dataset, and writes a separate immutable-looking filesystem publication. It does not register that analysis as another laboratory activity, attach its files as artifacts, create evidence records, or update the project graph. fileciteturn56file0L34-L84

Consequently, a scientist still has to:

1. maintain the planned experiment in the graph;
2. execute runs in the laboratory;
3. run analysis separately;
4. inspect the outputs;
5. create or edit evidence;
6. update hypothesis confidence and status;
7. create a decision;
8. render a report.

Human review should remain mandatory for scientific interpretation. The problem is not the lack of automatic hypothesis acceptance. The problem is the lack of automatic **drafting and linking** of factual results:

- which runs fulfilled which experiment;
- whether all expected outputs were produced;
- whether metric thresholds passed;
- which analysis consumed which run set;
- which analysis artifacts support an evidence record;
- which protocol and environment generated the result.

Closing this loop should be the highest-level product objective.

## It provides auditability, but not computational reconstruction

The execution identity currently contains the domain, input artifact references, opaque domain configuration, requested measures, and factors. It does not include the runner binary, source revision, dependency environment, container, command line, or host configuration. fileciteturn84file0L41-L59

For external runners, the recorded environment consists only of operating system, architecture, and names of designated secret environment variables. fileciteturn95file0L30-L32

At the same time, the worker process inherits the host environment. When an explicit environment is provided it is appended to `os.Environ`; otherwise Go’s process execution inherits the current environment by default. fileciteturn92file0L105-L116

This creates two problems:

1. **Reproducibility:** important environment variables can affect the computation without appearing in the ledger.
2. **Least privilege:** the runner may receive undeclared credentials or configuration. Secret-canary checking protects only explicitly configured values and exact leaks, not all inherited state.

A credible execution manifest should capture, at minimum:

- source repository and commit;
- dirty-tree patch or source archive digest;
- entrypoint script or binary digest;
- exact arguments;
- runner binary or package digest;
- lockfile, Conda/Nix environment, or container image digest;
- explicitly allowed environment variables;
- locale, timezone, and relevant numeric-library settings;
- RNG implementation and seeds;
- operating system/kernel;
- relevant CPU, GPU, driver, accelerator, or instrument information;
- calibration and firmware where applicable.

This is also where the current resume logic differs from established workflow-system practice. Nextflow includes the task container, software environments, inputs, task script, referenced globals, and bundled scripts in its cache hash; it reuses a task only when the hash matches and required outputs and the exit code are valid. citeturn610609view0

`researchctl` currently records enough to say, “this run record has not normally been edited and these files match these digests.” It does not record enough to say, “another researcher can reconstruct the computation that produced them.”

## The current resume semantics contain a serious correctness defect

A plan run is found using only:

```text
(specification ID, replicate index)
```

The query does not include plan digest, runner identity, software environment, or study instance. fileciteturn82file0L54-L72

In the scheduler, an existing active run causes an error. Every other existing status is marked `resumed`, including failed, cancelled, or abandoned runs. The scheduler increments `Resumed`, does not increment `Failed`, and returns successfully when there are no pending runs. fileciteturn83file0L95-L114

That has several consequences:

- A previously failed terminal run can satisfy a desired replicate.
- A plan containing only previously failed runs can return without an execution error.
- Changing the runner version does not invalidate the existing result.
- Changing the software environment does not invalidate it.
- Revising ordering or execution policy can silently reuse observations from an earlier study.
- A run created for one plan can satisfy another plan with the same specification and replicate slot.

This is more than a small bug. It exposes a conceptual conflation between:

1. a **scientific run or observation**;
2. a **desired replicate slot in a study**;
3. a **computational cache entry**.

They should be separate records.

A better model would be:

```text
protocol revision
  -> study instance
      -> case assignment
          -> desired replicate slot
              -> run
                  -> attempts

execution fingerprint
  -> optional reusable cache entry

run
  -> optionally materialized from cache entry
```

A new study should obtain its own run record even when computation is reused. The run would explicitly state that its output was reused from a prior execution. A failed terminal run should never satisfy a desired replicate unless the scientist explicitly waives or excludes it.

The execution fingerprint should include the code, inputs, environment, runner, relevant engine versions, and seeds. Plan membership should be stored as a first-class relation containing the plan digest, case ID, schedule ordinal, and study instance—not embedded only in attempt environment JSON. The current code does at least preserve plan ID, digest, and artifact path in attempt provenance, which is useful, but that provenance is not part of the lookup decision. fileciteturn83file0L221-L249

## “Blocked ordering” is not a statistical block design

The implementation’s blocked ordering interleaves the first replicate of each case, then the second replicate of each case, and so forth. fileciteturn63file0L74-L90

That can reduce simple time-order confounding, but a scientist may interpret “blocked” as:

- assignment within explicit blocks or strata;
- randomization inside blocks;
- experimental units assigned according to a block design;
- block effects represented in analysis.

None of those semantics are present. A less misleading name would be `round-robin` or `interleaved`.

There is also a distinction between **planned order** and **realized temporal order**. The plan expansion is deterministic, but concurrent workers execute several scheduled runs at once. Start and completion order can vary. fileciteturn83file0L117-L170

For order-sensitive experiments, the system should persist:

- assignment order;
- admission order;
- actual start order and timestamps;
- worker/resource assignment;
- completion order;
- deviations from the randomized schedule.

It should not imply that queue ordering alone implements a controlled randomized design.

## Artifact custody is strong, but the transport does not scale

The external runner emits artifacts as a byte array inside an NDJSON frame. fileciteturn91file0L47-L56

The maximum frame size defaults to 32 MiB. Because a Go `[]byte` is encoded as base64 in JSON, the practical raw artifact limit is roughly 24 MiB or less after framing overhead. fileciteturn92file0L26-L38 fileciteturn93file0L9-L37

That is acceptable for:

- JSON reports;
- CSV summaries;
- small plots;
- compact logs;
- small model outputs.

It is unsuitable as the general path for:

- imaging data;
- sequencing outputs;
- checkpoints;
- model weights;
- large tabular datasets;
- video;
- instrument dumps;
- directory trees;
- multi-gigabyte intermediate results.

The worker protocol should transport **artifact declarations**, not artifact bytes:

```json
{
  "type": "artifact",
  "artifact": {
    "role": "model",
    "path": "/staging/output/model.bin",
    "expectedDigest": "sha256:...",
    "expectedSize": 1849920172
  }
}
```

`researchctl` could then verify and import the file from a per-attempt staging directory. Remote executors could provide `s3:`, OCI, HTTPS, or catalog references. Streaming and multipart upload should be separate transports.

The artifact store also needs eventual lifecycle features:

- deduplication;
- remote object-store support;
- verification and repair;
- packing and export;
- garbage collection based on reachability;
- retention and legal-hold policies;
- explicit redaction or tombstone records;
- access control for sensitive data.

Hard no-delete triggers are defensible for a local experimental ledger, but not sufficient for human-subject, confidential, or regulated data.

## Scientific design coverage is too thin

The core plan has cases, opaque factors, replicate counts, and ordering. It does not provide first-class semantics for:

- samples, subjects, specimens, cohorts, or experimental units;
- factor types, units, allowed levels, and derived factors;
- randomization units and allocation concealment;
- blocking and stratification;
- blinding;
- inclusion and exclusion criteria;
- stopping rules;
- missing-data policy;
- power or sample-size rationale;
- protocol deviations;
- instrument identity and calibration;
- preregistration and amendments.

Some of this should remain domain-specific. But the core needs extensible, schema-validated slots for it.

A useful precedent is Portable Encapsulated Projects, which separates reusable sample metadata from analysis, uses familiar YAML and CSV structures, supports JSON Schema validation, and has R, Python, and workflow-system integrations. citeturn446354search6

A productive model would be:

```text
protocol revision        immutable once frozen
sample/unit table         separately schema-validated
case assignment table    materialized and immutable
workflow definition       executable
execution records         retrospective
analysis records          retrospective
evidence/decisions        reviewed interpretation
```

Protocol amendments should create a new revision with an explanation, not mutate the original specification.

## The analysis layer is useful but over-positioned

The analysis engine has legitimate strengths:

- deterministic dataset construction;
- selected-metric publication;
- missing-value awareness;
- unit checks;
- basic reducers;
- deterministic CSV, JSON, SVG, and Markdown artifacts;
- digests over source, dataset, and result. fileciteturn66file0L17-L47 fileciteturn66file0L70-L79

As implemented, however, it is a **summary and reporting engine**, not a general scientific analysis environment.

The dataset is limited to 16 MiB. Individual selected metric values are limited to 64 KiB. Artifact and trace contents are excluded; only their counts are exposed. fileciteturn85file0L13-L67 fileciteturn85file0L70-L134

The available abstraction supports grouped reducers and basic charts. It does not reasonably replace ordinary R, Python, Julia, Stan, MATLAB, or domain-specific analysis tools for:

- regression;
- mixed-effects models;
- repeated-measures designs;
- ANOVA;
- nonparametric tests;
- bootstrapping;
- multiple-comparison corrections;
- Bayesian models;
- survival analysis;
- domain-specific uncertainty propagation.

There is also a concrete API/implementation mismatch: `Chart` exposes a `Series` property, but the SVG renderer ignores it and draws one undifferentiated point sequence. fileciteturn86file0L78-L84 fileciteturn96file0L45-L95

The current engine should be renamed or positioned as something like:

```text
researchctl summarize
```

It is appropriate for completeness reports, quality-control summaries, standard comparisons, and quick deterministic charts. General analysis should execute as another fully recorded workflow step in a pinned environment. Its source, dataset, dependencies, logs, outputs, and environment should then be registered in the same provenance ledger.

## The user-facing surface is overengineered

The underlying ledger is not the overengineered part. The product surface is.

A new user encounters:

- YAML project files;
- JSON project files;
- trusted JavaScript project DSLs;
- pure JavaScript experiment-plan DSLs;
- closed JavaScript analysis specifications;
- a CPU/GPU codesign-specific DSL;
- a generic external NDJSON runner protocol;
- an external Scraper workflow engine;
- `xgoja`, `jsverbs`, plugins, and a browser workbench;
- separate project, laboratory, experiment, analysis, render, and apply command families. fileciteturn70file0L24-L91 fileciteturn70file0L115-L149

The JavaScript modes have different security and execution rules:

- project JavaScript is explicitly trusted code; fileciteturn70file0L55-L68
- plan JavaScript is described as pure and compiled to JSON; fileciteturn57file0L23-L52
- analysis JavaScript is a closed specification; fileciteturn56file0L22-L31
- the workbench server exposes persistent JavaScript REPL sessions restricted to selected native modules. fileciteturn60file0L60-L92

This is explainable to the implementer. It is not a coherent mental model for a new scientist.

Several names are also likely to mislead:

- **`apply`** sounds like execution but actually materializes generated project files. fileciteturn70file0L93-L103
- **work package** sounds executable but is project-management metadata containing dependencies, inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria. fileciteturn87file0L4-L18
- **blocked ordering** means interleaving, not a block design.
- **immutable** means protected by local database triggers, not cryptographically immutable.
- **experiment run** still has a codesign-specific primary path, while the product also claims to be domain-neutral. fileciteturn75file0L18-L38

The plugin registry is another example of premature surface area. It defines extension points for templates, review rules, report blocks, source importers, evidence validators, and view renderers, while the README states that the executable project-local plugin runtime is deferred. fileciteturn61file0L29-L88 fileciteturn70file0L145-L149

Similarly, the current browser workbench backend is predominantly a persistent JavaScript REPL service rather than a scientist-facing interface for inspecting protocol revisions, run completeness, artifacts, provenance, exclusions, and evidence. fileciteturn60file0L71-L92

The product should hide most of this until one generic workflow is excellent.

## Does the control-plane/data-plane split make sense?

Yes.

The project’s architecture document explicitly assigns:

- cases, factors, replicates, ordering, custody, and cross-run analysis to `researchctl`;
- jobs, leases, task retries, gates, budgets, and external effects to Scraper Workflow V3;
- domain semantics to domain toolkits. fileciteturn68file0L81-L127

This is a reasonable separation. A provenance system should not necessarily become another Kubernetes, Slurm, Nextflow, or Snakemake.

The problem is the **product boundary**, not the conceptual boundary. The current tutorial requires users to build another repository, configure an external runner, prepare several artifact roots, and supply a long set of low-level runner identity and cancellation options. fileciteturn69file0L22-L77

In other words:

> The control-plane/data-plane separation is sound, but the integration is exposed as architecture homework for the user.

There are two viable directions:

1. Package the external workflow engine as an invisible, first-party component with one installer and one command.
2. Make the execution boundary engine-neutral and provide adapters for established tools such as CWL, Snakemake, Nextflow, Slurm, and the existing Scraper engine.

The second direction is more broadly useful. CWL is specifically an open, vendor-neutral standard for connecting command-line tools into portable workflows. citeturn935356search0turn935356search6 Snakemake already supports ordinary shell, Python, R, and notebook code, pinned per-rule environments, containers, and self-contained workflow archives. citeturn446354search0 Nextflow similarly emphasizes reuse of existing scripts, containers, tracked intermediates, resume, and multiple local, cluster, cloud, and HPC executors. citeturn935356search7

`researchctl` does not need to reimplement those execution ecosystems to add value.

# Recommended fundamental shift in scripting

The product should stop trying to make JavaScript the common language for project definition, experiment planning, domain configuration, analysis, and interactive work.

A better division is:

## 1. Canonical protocol data

The scientific protocol should be portable YAML or JSON with a versioned schema:

```yaml
schemaVersion: researchctl-protocol/v1
id: EXP-001
hypotheses: [H-001]

design:
  factors:
    optimizer:
      levels: [adam, sgd]
    batchSize:
      levels: [32, 64]
      unit: samples
  replicates: 5
  randomization:
    unit: training-run
    method: permuted-block
    seed: 42

workflow:
  engine: snakemake
  entrypoint: workflow/Snakefile
  revision: git:8b1fd4...

environment:
  container: ghcr.io/example/study@sha256:...

expectedOutputs:
  - role: metrics
    path: results/metrics.json
    mediaType: application/json
  - role: model
    path: results/model.bin
```

JavaScript, Python, or R may generate this document, but the frozen output—not the generator runtime—is the portable protocol.

## 2. Ordinary executable scripts

Scientists should continue writing:

- shell commands;
- Python scripts;
- R scripts;
- Julia programs;
- notebooks;
- domain-native binaries.

The common local runner contract can be file-based:

```text
attempt/
  request.json
  inputs/
  work/
  outputs/
  result.json
  stdout.log
  stderr.log
```

The program writes outputs into the attempt directory and exits. `researchctl` verifies the manifest and files. A specialized streaming NDJSON SDK can remain available for long-running instrumentation, but it should not be the first or only integration path.

## 3. An external workflow executor

The workflow executor owns:

- step DAGs;
- resources;
- task scheduling;
- task-level retries;
- clusters and clouds;
- containers;
- task caching;
- large intermediates.

`researchctl` owns:

- protocol versions;
- cases and replicate assignments;
- study instances;
- run and attempt identities;
- execution fingerprints;
- artifact custody;
- cross-run provenance;
- result-to-evidence linking;
- reproducibility packaging.

## 4. Ordinary analysis code

The existing closed reducer layer can remain for routine summaries. Serious analysis should be normal code executed in a pinned environment and registered as another provenance activity.

This also enables standard provenance export. W3C PROV already provides interoperable concepts for entities, activities, agents, usage, generation, derivation, plans, and responsibility. citeturn646849search0 Workflow Run RO-Crate distinguishes prospective provenance—the intended workflow—from retrospective provenance—what actually executed—and can describe step executions and intermediate outputs. citeturn646849search1turn646849search6

A `researchctl pack` command should produce a Workflow Run RO-Crate containing:

- protocol and plan;
- workflow source;
- code and dependency identities;
- inputs and outputs;
- run and step provenance;
- environment and software;
- logs;
- analyses;
- evidence and decisions;
- licenses, creators, and persistent identifiers.

That would make the custom internal ledger interoperable rather than requiring other tools to understand every `researchctl-*` schema.

# Implementation quality

The implementation quality is materially better than the product design would suggest.

### Strong implementation choices

- Strict JSON decoding and unknown-field rejection.
- Canonical representations and content digests.
- Clear distinction between attempts and replicates.
- Append-only database behavior.
- Transactional recording.
- Required metric validation.
- Artifact path confinement and digest verification.
- Runner handshake and domain/version checking.
- Cancellation and timeout handling.
- Secret-leak tests.
- Deterministic plan and analysis tests.
- Integration tests across process runner, SQLite, exports, and artifacts. fileciteturn63file0L16-L113 fileciteturn67file0L17-L89 fileciteturn67file0L91-L172

### Important implementation concerns

**Resume correctness** is currently the highest-severity issue.

**Environment inheritance** needs to change from inherit-everything to deny-by-default plus an explicit allowlist.

**Observation write performance** may become poor at volume. Each event, metric, and trace currently opens and commits its own SQLite transaction. High-frequency telemetry should be batched or stored as compressed event artifacts with indexed summaries. fileciteturn80file0L10-L45 fileciteturn80file0L104-L142

**Active-run visibility** is inconsistent. The main run-list query inner-joins terminal run summaries, so it excludes active runs even though the system has separate active-run follow support. fileciteturn82file0L75-L100

**Logs are over-redacted.** On worker failure, stderr is reduced to byte count and SHA-256 rather than retained as a policy-controlled, sanitized diagnostic artifact. That protects secrets but makes failures unnecessarily difficult to diagnose. fileciteturn93file0L39-L44

**Exact software identity is not verified.** The user supplies a runner name and version, and the process announces matching strings. The actual executable digest is not recorded or attested. fileciteturn57file0L209-L223 fileciteturn93file0L136-L150

**Schema and feature surface are changing too quickly.** Changes of the observed scale should be split into smaller, independently reviewable increments with migration fixtures and compatibility tests.

Overall:

- **storage and artifact core:** good;
- **runner protocol:** good for small local integrations;
- **scheduler correctness:** promising but currently unsafe around resume;
- **analysis core:** competent but narrow;
- **product integration:** weak;
- **new-user experience:** poor;
- **maturity:** prototype-stage.

# Priority roadmap

## Phase 1: Correctness before more features

1. Treat only successful, compatible runs as reusable.
2. Introduce study instances, desired replicate slots, execution fingerprints, and separate cache entries.
3. Include source, runner binary, environment, container, command, inputs, and seeds in execution identity or compatibility checks.
4. Run external processes in a clean, explicitly allowed environment.
5. Persist plan membership, case assignment, schedule ordinal, and realized execution order as first-class records.
6. Validate actual metrics and artifacts against the graph’s expectations.
7. Make resumed failures visible and return a nonzero result.
8. Add regression tests for failed resume, runner-version changes, plan revisions, and environment changes.

## Phase 2: Close the scientific loop

1. Automatically create a result summary after a study.
2. Create draft evidence records linked to runs and analyses.
3. Render reports from the graph, laboratory, and analysis records together.
4. Record analysis executions as provenance activities and their files as artifacts.
5. Add protocol freezing and explicit amendment history.
6. Add generic sample, experimental-unit, instrument, exclusion, and deviation schemas.
7. Make `check-done` inspect actual run completeness rather than primarily manual statuses.

## Phase 3: Reduce the product surface

1. Provide one generic ten-minute tutorial using a shell or Python script—not codesign or a second repository.
2. Make laboratory initialization automatic.
3. Prefer one canonical YAML/JSON protocol format.
4. Retain scripting only as an optional compiler into canonical data.
5. Rename `apply` to `scaffold`, `materialize`, or `render-workspace`.
6. Rename blocked ordering to interleaved or implement real block semantics.
7. Move codesign, plugin development, `xgoja`, and the REPL workbench out of the primary user path.
8. Present the closed analysis system as optional summarization.

## Phase 4: Scale and interoperability

1. Replace inline artifact bytes with staging, streaming, or remote references.
2. Add content-addressed storage, deduplication, verification, repair, retention, and garbage collection.
3. Add CWL/Snakemake/Nextflow/Scraper executor adapters.
4. Export W3C PROV and Workflow Run RO-Crate.
5. Add licensing, creator/ORCID, citation, and DOI-oriented packaging.
6. Add multiuser and remote-storage modes only after the local model stabilizes.

# Bottom line

The approach makes sense **when narrowly defined**:

> `researchctl` should be a protocol freezer, experiment control plane, provenance ledger, artifact verifier, evidence linker, and reproducibility packager.

It should not become another general workflow language, another statistical environment, another notebook system, and another plugin platform simultaneously.

For controlled simulation, software benchmarking, RAG evaluation, or similar computational studies inside the existing go-go-golems ecosystem, the current core is already useful. The unsafe resume semantics should be fixed before relying on it for consequential results.

For a general scientist arriving at the repository, it does not yet adequately manage the full chain of executable steps, computational environment, large artifacts, scientific design, analysis provenance, and result-to-evidence closure. The winning version of the product is therefore **smaller and more compositional**, not larger: ordinary scientific scripts and established workflow engines underneath, with `researchctl` providing the rigorous research record around them.

**Planning design guide**

I'm preparing to gather up-to-date standards for ML design, possibly using a current GitHub repo as context. I'll need to invest time into primary sources and best practices.

**Planning design guide**

I’m thinking through whether the user wants a long written response or a downloadable document. I’ll focus on creating a structured design document and support it with relevant citations. I'll check for updated standards.

**Planned design guide**

</details>

```json
{"search_query":[{"q":"site:mlflow.org/docs/latest tracking experiments runs artifacts official"},{"q":"site:openlineage.io/docs specification run event dataset job official"},{"q":"site:w3.org/TR/prov-o PROV-O official recommendation"},{"q":"site:researchobject.org workflow run crate profile official"}],"response_length":"long"}
```

I’ll treat the repository as design evidence, then derive a greenfield architecture from an end-to-end RAG study covering execution, provenance, artifacts, analysis, APIs, failure semantics, and implementation phases.

<details><summary>💭 Thinking</summary>

**Searched 4 websites**

**Designing from scratch**

I’m aiming to create a detailed design guide around an ML pipeline. User's looking for a clear, clean system—fleshing out evaluation metrics, architecture, workflows, and core components. I'll use previous references as needed.

**Designing architecture**

I’m considering whether to build a custom DAG executor or use existing systems. The RAG pipeline calls for parallelism and caching, so proper execution and tracking are key. I’ll weigh options for flexibility.

**Designed architecture**

</details>

The key boundary is immutable protocols above ordinary tasks and executors, joined by content-addressed provenance; parameter sweeps compile into a deduplicated artifact DAG, not isolated runs.

Each arm and replicate remains a distinct scientific run, while identical stage computations may reuse verified cache entries through explicit provenance rather than silent resume.

# Researchctl 2: clean architecture for reproducible RAG research

I treated the existing repository as a source of hard-won implementation knowledge, but not as a compatibility constraint. The resulting greenfield architecture is documented here:

[Download the full architecture and design guide](sandbox:/mnt/data/researchctl2_rag_architecture_guide.md)

The guide is approximately 2,000 lines and includes the detailed domain model, RAG artifact graph, protocol schema, assignment and randomization model, execution IR, cache semantics, storage schema, worker contract, CLI, security model, interoperability plan, implementation packages, testing strategy, and delivery roadmap.

## Executive conclusion

The new `researchctl` should be narrowly defined as a:

> **Scientific control plane, provenance ledger, artifact custody system, and reproducibility packager.**

It should not simultaneously become:

- a new workflow programming language;
- a statistical analysis language;
- a notebook runtime;
- a generic project-management graph;
- a JavaScript application platform;
- a workflow scheduler competing with Nextflow, Snakemake, CWL engines, Slurm, Kubernetes, or the existing Scraper workflow system.

The clean architecture has four explicit layers:

```text
Protocol
  What the scientist intends to investigate

Study
  Which cases, blocks, randomization assignments, and replicate slots
  have been frozen for this particular experiment

Execution
  What code, environment, hardware, inputs, steps, and attempts
  actually ran and what they produced

Interpretation
  Which analyses were performed, what evidence was reviewed,
  and what decisions were made
```

This separation follows the useful distinction between prospective provenance—plans and workflows—and retrospective provenance—actual executions and generated entities. Workflow Run RO-Crate makes the same distinction, while W3C PROV provides the more general entity/activity/agent model for interoperable provenance. citeturn158320search1turn158320search3

# 1. The concrete RAG research scenario

Consider a scientist studying a RAG system over a large technical corpus. The pipeline is not a single “RAG configuration.” It contains interacting decisions across the entire information flow:

```text
Source corpus
    |
    v
parse and normalize documents
    |
    v
chunk documents
    |
    +------> generate chunk summaries
    |
    +------> generate likely questions
    |
    v
create searchable representations
    |
    +------> lexical index
    |
    +------> embeddings -> vector index
    |
    v
retrieve candidates
    |
    v
hybrid fusion
    |
    v
rerank
    |
    v
deduplicate, diversify, expand parents, and pack context
    |
    v
generate answer and citations
    |
    v
evaluate retrieval, answer quality, faithfulness, latency, and cost
```

Representative factors include:

- chunking method;
- chunk length and overlap;
- structural boundary policy;
- summary generation model and prompt;
- number and style of synthetic questions;
- embedding model and dimensions;
- vector normalization;
- lexical analyzer and BM25 settings;
- ANN construction and search parameters;
- lexical, vector, or hybrid retrieval;
- fusion algorithm and weight;
- retrieval candidate count;
- reranker and reranking depth;
- context token budget;
- diversity and parent-expansion policy;
- answer model and prompt;
- answer temperature and seed;
- query concurrency;
- embedding batch size;
- provider parallelism;
- accelerator class.

A modest Cartesian product can produce 5,832 configurations. Three run-level replicates yield 17,496 runs before considering answer-level stochastic samples or repeated judge measurements.

The system therefore has to manage an **experiment program**, not merely execute a parameter sweep.

---

# 2. The most important conceptual correction

The prototype has a strong distinction between a run and an attempt, but the plan scheduler still identifies existing work using essentially:

```text
(specification ID, replicate index)
```

The database query is keyed by those values, while the scheduler treats any non-active terminal run as resumed. fileciteturn82file0L54-L72 fileciteturn83file0L95-L114

That conflates three different concepts:

1. **Scientific assignment**  
   A planned replicate slot for a case in a specific study.

2. **Run occurrence**  
   The actual observation that attempted to fill that assignment.

3. **Computational cache entry**  
   Previously generated outputs that may be reusable under a compatibility policy.

The new architecture makes them separate:

```text
Protocol revision
    |
    v
Study
    |
    v
Assignment ---------------------------+
    |                                  |
    v                                  |
Run                                    |
    |                                  |
    v                                  |
Attempt                                |
    |                                  |
    v                                  |
Step run ---- execution fingerprint --> Cache record
    |
    v
Artifacts and observations
```

A cache hit saves computation, but still creates a new run and step-run occurrence for the current study. It records:

```text
materialized_from_cache:
  cache_record: ...
  producer_step_run: ...
  verified_outputs: [...]
```

A previously failed run never satisfies a replicate slot. A cancelled or abandoned run does not count. A replacement run receives a new run ID and is linked to the failed run.

This single separation removes many of the prototype’s most serious semantic problems.

---

# 3. The authoritative objects

## Protocol revision

A protocol revision is a frozen, content-addressed statement of:

- research questions and hypotheses;
- corpus and evaluation-set identities;
- primary and secondary outcomes;
- treatment factors;
- blocking factors and covariates;
- conditional constraints;
- replication and randomization policy;
- failure, exclusion, and replacement rules;
- pipeline template;
- analysis plan;
- stopping rules;
- resource budget;
- reproducibility expectations.

A protocol starts as a mutable draft. Freezing produces a canonical JSON document and digest. An amendment creates a child revision; it does not edit the original.

## Study

A study binds a protocol revision to a particular design realization:

- design generator;
- design-generator version;
- randomization seed;
- assignment table;
- blocks;
- study stage;
- execution policy;
- budget;
- development or confirmatory designation.

Two studies may use the same protocol but different assignments, randomization, or datasets.

## Case

A case is a unique scientific treatment combination after defaults and conditions are resolved.

For example:

```yaml
chunk:
  method: structural
  targetTokens: 512
  overlapTokens: 64

enrichment:
  mode: summary-and-questions
  summaryModel: summary-small
  questionCount: 3

embedding:
  model: embed-large-v3

retrieval:
  kind: hybrid
  topK: 20
  fusion:
    method: weighted
    alpha: "0.50"

rerank:
  kind: cross-encoder
  candidates: 20

answer:
  model: answer-large
  promptVersion: answer-v4
```

The case digest contains scientific configuration. It does not contain display names, timestamps, scheduler queue depth, or occurrence IDs.

## Assignment

An assignment represents a desired scientific observation:

```text
study
+ case
+ block
+ replicate index
+ randomized ordinal
```

An assignment remains unfilled until a valid run succeeds or the scientist explicitly excludes or waives it with a recorded reason.

## Run and attempt

A run is a scientific occurrence. An attempt is an operational retry.

```text
Assignment A
    |
    +-- Run 1
          |
          +-- Attempt 1: provider timeout
          +-- Attempt 2: succeeded
```

An additional independent replicate is another assignment, not another attempt.

## Step run

A step run is the realized execution of one workflow node:

- chunk documents;
- generate summaries;
- create embeddings;
- build an index;
- retrieve;
- rerank;
- answer;
- evaluate.

Step runs have exact input and output artifact edges and their own cache disposition.

---

# 4. Parameters must have scientific roles

The system should not infer the meaning of a parameter from its name. Each parameter is explicitly classified as:

| Role | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `treatment` | Intentionally varied to estimate an effect |
| `block` | Known nuisance factor used in assignment and analysis |
| `covariate` | Measured context that may explain variation |
| `fixed` | Scientifically relevant but not varied |
| `execution` | Scheduler or operational policy |
| `secret` | External reference whose value is never serialized |

This is particularly important for parallelism.

```yaml
serving:
  queryConcurrency: 32
```

could mean either:

- “execute 32 queries concurrently because it is faster,” which is operational; or
- “measure how concurrency affects latency, failures, cost, and possibly output behavior,” which is a treatment.

The two uses must not share identity semantics.

---

# 5. A frozen assignment table, not a mutable sweep loop

The design compiler should output an immutable assignment artifact:

| Assignment | Case | Block | Replicate | Randomized order |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| ASN-001 | CASE-A | day-1 / gpu-a | 1 | 14 |
| ASN-002 | CASE-B | day-1 / gpu-a | 1 | 2 |
| ASN-003 | CASE-A | day-2 / gpu-b | 2 | 7 |

The assignment table is included in the study digest.

Supported initial design modes should remain small:

- constrained grid;
- seeded random;
- space-filling design;
- user-authored CSV or Parquet table;
- finalists selected from a previous stage;
- adaptive ask/tell waves.

Advanced design generation can live in Python or statistical packages. The core needs to preserve the resulting assignments and the provenance of how they were generated.

## Staged RAG experimentation

A defensible RAG program should usually be staged:

### Calibration

Use a small question subset to test schemas, metrics, failure handling, prompts, judge calibration, and resource estimates.

### Screening

Use a budgeted design to identify influential factors and obvious interactions.

### Focused comparison

Use balanced and blocked comparisons among a small set of promising regions.

### Confirmation

Freeze finalists and analysis before opening the holdout data.

Screening followed by focused experimentation is a standard DOE pattern when many candidate factors are present. NIST explicitly distinguishes screening designs from later response-surface or focused modeling, and defines blocking as accounting for nuisance factors while randomizing within blocks. citeturn510932search1turn510932search8turn510932search9

“Blocked” must not merely mean round-robin execution. A real block is a recorded nuisance variable such as day, machine type, provider region, or index batch.

---

# 6. The RAG pipeline should be a typed artifact graph

Recommended artifact types include:

```text
rag/corpus-snapshot/v1
rag/document-set/v1
rag/chunk-set/v1
rag/chunk-summary-set/v1
rag/synthetic-question-set/v1
rag/embedding-set/v1
rag/lexical-index/v1
rag/vector-index/v1
rag/retrieval-results/v1
rag/context-set/v1
rag/answer-set/v1
rag/evaluation-table/v1
```

Each artifact has:

- digest;
- size;
- media type;
- logical schema;
- storage URI;
- producing step;
- parent/input artifacts;
- data classification;
- retention policy.

This graph enables correct partial reuse:

- changing the answer prompt reuses retrieval and indexing;
- changing reranking reuses raw retrieval candidates;
- changing `top_k` reuses indexes;
- changing embedding model reuses chunks but rebuilds embeddings and vector indexes;
- changing chunking invalidates every downstream representation.

The planner compiles all cases into a DAG of **unique materializations**. It does not execute a separate complete pipeline for every case.

---

# 7. Canonical protocol data, optional Python authoring

The authoritative protocol should be JSON-compatible data, normally authored as YAML.

A Python SDK is valuable because the target users are ML scientists, but Python is a compiler, not the durable format:

```python
from researchctl import Protocol, Factor

protocol = (
    Protocol("RAG-CORPUS-QUALITY-01")
    .factor(
        Factor.categorical(
            "chunk.method",
            ["recursive", "structural", "semantic"],
        )
    )
    .factor(Factor.integer("retrieval.topK", [5, 10, 20]))
)

protocol.write("protocol.compiled.json")
```

The source Python file is retained as provenance. The compiled canonical document is reviewed, frozen, signed if required, and used as the protocol identity.

JSON canonicalization should use RFC 8785 JCS through a maintained implementation. JCS exists specifically to provide invariant JSON representations suitable for reliable hashing and signing. citeturn724940search0

A digest should also be domain-separated:

```text
sha256("researchctl:protocol:v1\0" + JCS(protocol))
sha256("researchctl:study:v1\0" + JCS(study))
sha256("researchctl:execution-plan:v1\0" + JCS(plan))
```

Precise decimal factors should be represented as decimal strings or typed quantities rather than relying on ambiguous floating-point serialization.

---

# 8. Domain compiler and generic execution plan

The generic core should not know what an HNSW index, chunk summary, BM25 field, or reranker is.

Compilation occurs in three levels:

```text
ResearchProtocol
    |
    v
RagCasePlan
    |
    v
Generic ExecutionPlan
```

The RAG package owns the domain model and validates rules such as:

- hybrid retrieval requires both lexical and vector inputs;
- query and document embedding models must be compatible;
- reranker candidate count cannot exceed retrieval candidate count;
- context budget must fit the answer-model contract;
- irrelevant conditional factors must be absent;
- enrichment artifacts must derive from the correct chunk set;
- index engine and index snapshot schema must match.

The generic execution plan contains nodes with:

- implementation;
- command;
- source or binary digest;
- environment or container digest;
- typed inputs and outputs;
- parameters;
- resource requests;

# 9. Ordinary scripts and a file-based worker contract

A local step receives:

```text
step/
  request.json
  inputs/
  work/
  outputs/
  result.json
  logs/
    stdout.log
    stderr.log
  telemetry/
```

The process receives:

- read-only inputs;
- an empty output directory;
- explicit configuration;
- a minimal environment;
- secret handles;
- result paths.

It writes a terminal manifest:

```yaml
schemaVersion: researchctl-step-result/v1
status: succeeded

outputs:
  - role: retrieval-results
    path: outputs/retrieval.parquet
    logicalType: rag/retrieval-results/v1
    mediaType: application/vnd.apache.parquet

observations:
  summary:
    - name: retrieval.query_count
      value: 2000
      unit: queries
  sets:
    - path: outputs/retrieval-metrics.parquet
      schema: rag/retrieval-metrics/v1

telemetry:
  events: telemetry/events.jsonl.zst
  traces: telemetry/traces.jsonl.zst
```

A small event stream may communicate progress and heartbeats. It is not the artifact transport.

The prototype’s external protocol embeds artifact bytes in JSON frames, and its process runner defaults to a 32 MiB maximum frame. fileciteturn91file0L47-L56 fileciteturn92file0L26-L38

That should be replaced with filesystem or object-store staging. Large indexes, checkpoints, image collections, and embedding datasets must never traverse a base64 lifecycle message.

---

# 10. Correct cache identity

A step execution fingerprint should include:

- source bundle or binary digest;
- command and arguments;
- OCI image digest or environment-lock digest;
- exact input artifact digests;
- normalized parameters;
- RNG implementation and seed;
- executor semantics version;
- declared environment values;
- relevant secret reference versions;
- hardware or driver compatibility class where relevant;
- external provider, model, region, and request semantics;
- cache-policy version.

This is substantially closer to mature workflow caching than using only a specification ID. Nextflow, for example, incorporates task container/environment information, inputs, scripts, referenced values, and bundled scripts into task hashes, then also checks that required outputs and a valid exit code are present before reuse. citeturn153613view0L74-L120

The new model should preserve two notions:

```text
exact cache
  Same complete fingerprint and verified outputs

compatible cache
  Explicit policy allows reuse across a declared compatibility boundary
```

Compatibility must never be inferred opportunistically.

---

# 11. Reproducibility is classified, not claimed generically

Every step declares one of:

- `bitwise`;
- `deterministic-logical`;
- `statistical`;
- `provider-dependent`;
- `non-reproducible`.

For hosted LLM and embedding services, the system captures:

- requested model alias;
- resolved/returned model metadata;
- provider request ID;
- region;
- client version;
- prompt digest;
- parameters;
- response metadata;
- raw result where policy permits.

It should normally label such a step `provider-dependent`, because the system cannot guarantee that the provider will reproduce identical behavior later.

OCI image manifests are designed around content-addressable images and digest-addressed components, making image digests suitable environment identities when the actual platform-specific image is also resolved and recorded. citeturn712845search0turn712845search1

Runtime provenance should adopt the useful supply-chain distinction among external parameters, resolved dependencies, builder identity, and output subjects. SLSA provenance uses that structure to describe where, when, and how an artifact was produced. citeturn724940search9turn724940search1

---

# 12. Evaluation must remain modular and statistically honest

RAG evaluation should keep retrieval, context use, generation, and systems behavior separate.

RAGAS explicitly motivates separate dimensions such as context retrieval, faithful use of context, and generation quality. RAGChecker similarly treats modular diagnosis as necessary because a single aggregate score cannot identify where a RAG system failed. citeturn888461academia50turn888461academia48

The analysis dataset should expose linked tables such as:

```text
cases.parquet
assignments.parquet
runs.parquet
queries.parquet
retrieval_candidates.parquet
retrieval_metrics.parquet
contexts.parquet
answers.parquet
answer_metrics.parquet
system_metrics.parquet
failures.parquet
artifacts.parquet
```

Each observation declares:

- metric schema;
- unit;
- sample unit;
- scope;
- nesting relationship;
- producer;
- quality flags;
- missingness or failure reason.

A query-level NDCG value is not necessarily an independent replicate of an index-building treatment. Treating repeated query observations as independent experimental replicates is a form of pseudoreplication when the actual treatment units were not independently replicated. citeturn510932search12

The platform should therefore know the difference between:

```text
query observations nested inside one run

independent pipeline runs

independent index builds

multiple answer samples for one query

repeated LLM-judge measurements
```

The built-in system may provide completeness and summary views. Serious statistical analysis should remain ordinary Python, R, Julia, or another domain tool executed as a fully recorded analysis activity.

The prototype’s current analysis layer is deliberately narrow: it limits the dataset to 16 MiB, selected metric values to 64 KiB, and represents artifacts and traces only by counts. fileciteturn85file0L13-L67 fileciteturn85file0L70-L134

That code can survive as `researchctl summarize`, not as the primary scientific analysis system.

---

# 13. Evidence and decisions close the loop

After analysis, the system may automatically draft factual evidence:

```text
Analysis ANL-123 consumed study snapshot sha256:...
and included 69 of 72 planned assignments.

CASE-X exceeded baseline by an estimated 4.1 percentage points
for answer correctness, with uncertainty and diagnostics recorded
in artifact sha256:...
```

The scientist then reviews:

- supports, contradicts, or inconclusive;
- confidence;
- limitations;
- external validity;
- sensitivity to exclusions;
- failed-run implications;
- judge dependence.

A decision records:

- chosen configuration;
- rejected alternatives;
- evidence;
- operational constraints;
- confidence;
- follow-up study;
- reversal conditions.

Reports are generated by joining protocol, assignments, actual executions, analyses, reviewed evidence, and decisions. They are not rendered from a separate manually maintained project graph.

---

# 14. Interoperability rather than ecosystem isolation

Internally, use a typed relational schema. Export outward:

- W3C PROV for general provenance interchange;
- Workflow Run RO-Crate for a complete portable research object;
- OpenLineage for runtime job/dataset lineage;
- MLflow mappings for conventional run and artifact comparison;
- CWL, Snakemake, Nextflow, or Scraper adapters for execution.

CWL is explicitly designed as a portable standard for connecting command-line tools into workflows across laptops, clusters, clouds, and HPC systems. citeturn158320search0turn158320search2

Snakemake supports per-rule environments, containers, ordinary scripts and notebooks, and self-contained workflow archives; those capabilities should be integrated rather than rebuilt. citeturn858646search0

MLflow’s experiment/run/metric/artifact model is useful for comparison and interoperability, but it does not by itself provide frozen protocol revisions, randomized assignment tables, replicate-slot correctness, or reviewed evidence. citeturn911661search0

---

# 15. Implementation shape

## Go core

Use Go for:

- CLI;
- protocol and study validation;
- canonical identities;
- SQLite/PostgreSQL ledger;
- content-addressed artifact store;
- local process/container executor;
- verification;
- import/export;
- state machine.

## Python layer

Use Python for:

- ML-friendly authoring helpers;
- RAG domain compiler;
- reference RAG workers;
- experimental-design integration;
- analysis code;
- provider and index adapters.

Python is a convenience layer. JSON-compatible contracts remain language-neutral.

## Suggested packages

```text
researchctl/
  pkg/canonical
  pkg/identity
  pkg/protocol
  pkg/study
  pkg/ledger
  pkg/artifact
  pkg/execution
  pkg/provenance
  pkg/export
  adapters/executor/local
  adapters/executor/process
  adapters/executor/cwl
  sdk/python

researchctl-rag/
  schemas
  compiler
  workers
  metrics
  fixtures
```

The dependency direction is strict:

```text
RAG package -> researchctl contracts

researchctl core -X-> RAG package
```

# 16. What to retain from the prototype

Likely reusable after audit:

- safe artifact path confinement;
- file and tree verification;
- canonical run-export validation;
- run/attempt closure invariants;
- SQLite transaction patterns;
- process cancellation behavior;
- malformed-frame and secret-leak tests;
- deterministic schedule tests;
- CLI serialization utilities.

The prototype’s artifact verification is particularly solid: it confines paths, rejects traversal and symlink escape, verifies sizes and digests, and supports artifact-tree manifests. fileciteturn18file0L20-L124 fileciteturn19file0L62-L169

Rewrite rather than retain:

- global specification-plus-replicate uniqueness;
- current resume behavior;
- plan membership stored mainly in attempt environment;
- multiple JavaScript authoring runtimes;
- inline artifact frames;
- general-purpose claims for the reducer engine;
- graph-first report model;
- deferred generic plugin framework;
- workbench-first UX.

---

# 17. Delivery order

## Milestone 0: contracts

Freeze:

- canonicalization;
- protocol;
- study;
- assignment;
- run/attempt;
- artifact;
- result manifest;
- domain compiler;
- executor interface;
- relational schema.

## Milestone 1: local kernel

Build:

- SQLite;
- filesystem CAS;
- local process/container executor;
- clean environment;
- correct cache and resume semantics;
- inspect, follow, verify, and export.

## Milestone 2: RAG vertical slice

Implement:

- document;
- chunk;
- enrichment;
- embedding;
- lexical/vector indexing;
- retrieval;
- reranking;
- answer;
- evaluation.

Prove shared upstream reuse across multiple cases.

## Milestone 3: study design

Implement:

- assignment lock files;
- blocks;
- randomization;
- replacement and exclusion;
- staged studies;
- holdout access rules;
- adaptive ask/tell contract.

## Milestone 4: analysis and interpretation

Implement:

- tidy study snapshots;
- Python/R analysis execution;
- summaries;
- evidence drafting;
- decisions;
- integrated reports.

## Milestone 5: interoperability and remote execution

Implement:

- RO-Crate;
- PROV;
- OpenLineage;
- remote artifact store;
- one mature workflow-engine adapter.

## Milestone 6: shared service and UI

Only after the local model is stable:

- PostgreSQL;
- authorization;
- remote worker leases;
- team review;
- UI.

The UI must consume the same contracts rather than inventing another system model.

---

# Final architectural rule

The system should be built around this sentence:

> **A protocol freezes what the scientist intends; a study freezes what will be assigned; an executor records what happened; artifacts preserve what was produced; analysis derives results; humans review evidence and make decisions.**

That is the fundamental shift. It produces a smaller system than the prototype, but one capable of managing a genuinely complex RAG research program without confusing scientific design, workflow execution, caching, tracking, analysis, and interpretation.

# Scraper Workflow V3 as the Execution Layer for Researchctl 2

## Scientist-facing assessment, RAG workload analysis, and clean-architecture recommendations

**Repository reviewed:** `wesen/scraper`  
**Branch reviewed:** `task/benchmark-cpu-inference`  
**Review date:** 2026-07-24  
**Companion document:** [Researchctl 2: clean architecture for reproducible RAG research](researchctl2_rag_architecture_guide.md)

---

## Executive assessment

### Verdict

Scraper Workflow V3 is a technically serious execution-kernel prototype. It is substantially more coherent than the first `researchctl` implementation because it has one clear operational responsibility:

> Compile a typed workflow into an exact plan, persist its operational state, lease work to compatible implementations, fence stale attempts, verify outputs, and expose deterministic operational evidence.

That core direction is correct.

The current product, however, is not yet an appropriate general workflow executor for machine-learning scientists or for the proposed Researchctl 2 architecture. It is optimized around a proprietary JavaScript runtime, Go-compiled task packages, small in-memory artifacts, local SQLite, and one workflow run at a time. Those choices work for the current fixtures and prove difficult execution semantics, but they miss the ordinary capabilities a RAG experiment program needs:

- typed per-node parameters;
- Python, R, command-line, and container tasks;
- reproducible software environments;
- large files, directories, indexes, embedding matrices, and remote object stores;
- cross-run step caching and materialization reuse;
- structured CPU, memory, GPU, storage, network, and data-locality requirements;
- idempotent controller submission and reconnection;
- portable task packages that do not require rebuilding the Go binary;
- standard workflow and provenance interchange;
- first-class logs, checkpoints, and debugging artifacts.

The current implementation therefore serves our needs in two different ways:

1. **As a source of reusable execution-kernel code and semantics:** very well.
2. **As the product surface and task model for the clean system:** poorly.

The recommended treatment is the same as for the first `researchctl` prototype: retain the difficult, correct parts; set aside the surrounding product assumptions; rebuild the public contracts around ordinary scientific computation.

### Overall scorecard

| Area | Current assessment | RAG research relevance |
|---|---:|---|
| Durable workflow state | **8.5/10** | Strong foundation |
| Lease, retry, and stale-completion semantics | **9/10** | Strong foundation |
| Exact task implementation matching | **8.5/10** | Strong foundation |
| Small local artifact integrity | **8/10** | Useful but narrow |
| Operational metrics and failure evidence | **8/10** | Strong executor evidence |
| Security boundary for restricted tasks | **8/10** | Valuable Linux backend |
| New scientist experience | **3/10** | Too much proprietary machinery |
| Task-authoring flexibility | **2.5/10** | Does not fit normal ML code |
| First-class task parameters | **1.5/10** | Critical omission |
| Large-artifact and dataset handling | **2/10** | Unsuitable for realistic RAG data |
| Reproducible environment capture | **3/10** | Implementation bytes are pinned, environments are not complete |
| Cross-run computation reuse | **1/10** | Critical omission for experiment matrices |
| GPU/HPC/cloud execution | **2/10** | Resource model and backends are too limited |
| Researchctl integration | **5/10** | Careful, but duplicates custody and copies data |
| Current fit as our RAG executor | **3.5/10** | Requires a fundamental public-contract redesign |
| Potential after refactor | **9/10** | The kernel can support an excellent executor |

# Part I — Context and evaluation criteria

## 1. What the executor should own

In the proposed clean architecture, Researchctl 2 is the scientific control plane. It owns:

- protocol revisions;
- hypotheses and outcomes;
- cases, assignments, blocks, and replicates;
- study-level randomization;
- scientific run occurrence identities;
- analysis, evidence, and decisions;
- reproducibility packaging.

The workflow executor should own a narrower operational domain:

- executable step graphs;
- task implementation resolution;
- dependency scheduling;
- resource admission;
- task attempts and retries;
- cancellation and crash recovery;
- output publication;
- operational external effects;
- executor-level logs, events, and metrics.

The executor must not decide whether an observation is a scientific replicate, whether a hypothesis is supported, whether a failed run should be excluded, or whether a cached result is scientifically acceptable. It reports exact operational facts to the control plane.

This division is close to the stated Workflow V3 design. The branch describes JavaScript as a pure descriptor layer, compilation as the place where exact task and policy identities are pinned, SQLite as the authority for runs and leases, and a content-addressed root as payload custody. That is a sound executor boundary. See the [Workflow V3 product guide][product-guide].

## 2. Concrete RAG workload used for this review

The target scientist is investigating a complete RAG pipeline over a technical corpus.

```text
corpus snapshot
    |
    v
parse / normalize
    |
    v
chunk
    |
    +-------------------+
    |                   |
    v                   v
generate summaries   generate likely questions
    |                   |
    +---------+---------+
              |
              v
       enriched chunk set
              |
      +-------+--------+
      |                |
      v                v
 lexical index      embeddings
      |                |
      |                v
      |           vector index
      |                |
      +-------+--------+
              |
              v
       candidate retrieval
              |
              v
       fusion / reranking
              |
              v
      context construction
              |
              v
       answer generation
              |
              v
 retrieval, answer, faithfulness,
 latency, reliability, and cost evaluation
```

The study varies parameters at several layers:

- parser and normalization policy;
- chunking method, target size, overlap, and structural boundary policy;
- summary model, prompt, temperature, and concurrency;
- generated-question count and prompt version;
- embedding model, dimensions, normalization, and batch size;
- vector index type and construction/search parameters;
- lexical analyzer and BM25 parameters;
- lexical, vector, or hybrid retrieval;
- fusion algorithm and weight;
- candidate count and final `top_k`;
- reranker and reranking depth;
- parent expansion, deduplication, diversity, and token budget;
- answer model, prompt, temperature, and number of samples;
- query concurrency and provider limits;
- CPU, GPU, memory, and storage placement.

The executor must make this tractable across hundreds or thousands of cases. It must reuse shared upstream work rather than rebuilding the corpus, chunks, embeddings, and indexes for every downstream treatment combination.

## 3. Questions applied to the current branch

This review asks:

1. Can a new scientist express the workflow without learning an internal platform architecture?
2. Are inputs, parameters, code, environment, outputs, and side effects captured sufficiently for reproducibility?
3. Can the executor safely recover after crashes and retries?
4. Can it handle the size and shape of realistic RAG artifacts?
5. Can it avoid recomputing identical upstream steps across experiment cases?
6. Can ordinary Python, R, shell, and container code participate without bespoke Go integration?
7. Does it cleanly compose with Researchctl 2, or does it create duplicate run and artifact systems?
8. Are advanced features justified by the basic workflow product?
9. How strong is the implementation independent of the product design?

## 4. Review scope and limitations

The review covers the branch’s:

- product and operator guides;
- workflow IR and compiled-plan types;
- JavaScript authoring layer;
- compiler and validation logic;
- task bundles and registries;
- local content-addressed artifact store;
- SQLite schema and store;
- dispatcher, engine, map, reduction, gate, budget, and lease behavior;
- restricted Bubblewrap/cgroup executor;
- external-operation model;
- canonical operational observations;
- CLI and HTTP operator surface;
- Researchctl process bridge;
- representative tests and CI configuration.

This is a static source review. I did not independently execute the test suite or run RAG-scale benchmarks. The execution environment available for this review could not clone the repository over the network. Assertions about missing capabilities are based on the reviewed contracts, schema, command surface, and repository search; a capability hidden outside those surfaces could change a specific conclusion.

# Part II — What the implementation actually is

## 5. Current architectural model

Workflow V3 currently has the following layers:

```text
JavaScript workflow source
        |
        v
custom Goja authoring runtime
        |
        v
WorkflowIR
        |
        +---- task catalog / package set
        |
        v
WorkflowPlan with pinned identities
        |
        v
SQLite operational store
        |
        +---- dispatcher / leases / attempts
        +---- maps and reductions
        +---- budgets and gates
        +---- external-operation ledger
        |
        v
trusted in-process Goja task
or restricted Bubblewrap subprocess
        |
        v
content-addressed local artifact store
        |
        v
run snapshot and canonical operational observations
```

The public product is exposed through:

- `scraper workflow validate`;
- `scraper workflow explain`;
- `scraper workflow compile`;
- `scraper workflow submit`;
- `scraper workflow run`;
- `scraper worker run`;
- `scraper workflow runs list/show/follow/cancel`;
- `scraper workflow observations`;
- an optional HTTP operator API;
- `scraper-workflow-runner` for the first Researchctl prototype.

The product guide explicitly says Workflow V3 is the only scheduling and persistence authority inside Scraper and that plans cannot select host database paths, implementation bytes, modules, capacity, or secrets. These are good authority boundaries. See [product-guide] and the [minimal runtime guide][runtime-guide].

## 6. Workflow authoring model

A simple workflow is concise:

```javascript
const workflow = require("workflow");
const tasks = require("cookbook-linear-transform-tasks");

module.exports = workflow.compile(
  workflow.define("linear-transform", plan => {
    const source = plan.input("source", {
      schema: "customer-jsonl-ref/v1",
    });

    const normalized = plan.task(
      "normalize",
      tasks.normalizeCustomers({ source }),
    );

    const validated = plan.task(
      "validate",
      tasks.validateDataset({
        dataset: normalized.output("dataset"),
      }),
      job => job.after(normalized),
    );

    plan.output("dataset", validated.output("validatedDataset"));
  }),
);
```

This demonstrates an important strength: the workflow script does not perform execution. It builds a descriptor graph that is converted into typed Go IR and then compiled. The branch’s [cookbook example][cookbook-workflow] and [authoring implementation][authoring] enforce this distinction.

The DSL supports:

- scalar inputs;
- set inputs;
- tasks and dependencies;
- lazy map expansion;
- homogeneous reductions;
- approval gates;
- budgets;
- isolation policies;
- scalar and set outputs.

This is expressive enough for several internal data pipelines. It is not yet expressive enough or ergonomic enough for normal scientific workflows, for reasons developed below.

## 7. Task implementation and packaging model

JavaScript task code executes against a custom capability runtime:

```javascript
const task = require("workflow/task");
const fs = require("fs:input");

exports.normalizeCustomers = task.implementation(async ctx => {
  const text = await fs.readFile(ctx.input().source.path, "utf8");
  const rows = text.trim().split("\\n").map(JSON.parse);

  const dataset = await ctx.outputs.putJSON("dataset", {
    schema: "normalized-customers-ref/v1",
    value: rows,
  });

  return task.success({ dataset });
});
```

The script alone is not a deployable task package. A Go package embeds the JavaScript bytes, declares each task’s kind, version, entrypoint, inputs, outputs, modules, retry policy, resources, and isolation maximum, and contributes descriptor modules to the authoring runtime. See [cookbook-task-code], [cookbook-package], and [package-composition].

The production composition root currently hardcodes available packages and selects them by name. `--task-package` is therefore not a general package loader. It selects among packages already compiled into the binary.

This is one of the largest mismatches with the intended scientist audience.

## 8. Workflow plan and implementation identity

The compiled plan pins substantially more than a task name:

```text
task kind
+ task version
+ bundle digest
+ entrypoint
+ task ABI
+ input and output schemas
+ declared runtime modules
+ resource class
+ retry policy
+ budget policy
+ isolation policy
+ isolation executor digest
+ catalog digest
+ IR digest
+ plan digest
```

The registry resolves an exact `ImplementationIdentity`, not merely `kind@version`, and checks resource, retry, module, and isolation policy compatibility before a worker can acquire a node. See [workflow-types], [bundle], and [registry].

This is a very good design. It prevents the common failure mode in which a run claims it executed `task v1` but a different script or runtime implementation happened to be installed.

## 9. Durable run model

SQLite persists:

- the complete plan;
- run inputs;
- nodes and dependencies;
- map expansion state and materialized children;
- reduction levels and partitions;
- gates;
- budget accounts and reservations;
- attempts;
- lease tokens and cancellation epochs;
- external-operation admissions and completions;
- node outputs;
- operational events.

The store opens SQLite with foreign keys, WAL, `synchronous=FULL`, a busy timeout, and immediate transactions. Run creation persists the plan, exact task identities, policies, dependencies, and inputs in one transaction. See [sqlite-store] and [sqlite-schema].

Workers lease `(run_id, node_key)` work. Attempts receive monotonically increasing attempt numbers. Completion requires the current lease token and cancellation epoch. A stale or expired worker cannot publish outputs after another attempt has authority. This is the correct model for durable task execution.

## 10. Maps, reductions, gates, and budgets

The executor includes several advanced orchestration primitives.

### Lazy maps

A set is represented by an immutable ordered manifest. Map expansion is paged, durable, bounded, and backpressured. Child node identity derives from the map key, source-manifest digest, and canonical item key. Completion order does not determine output order. See [manifest] and [runtime-guide].

### Bounded reductions

Reductions form deterministic trees with fixed fan-in and maximum levels. Partition membership derives from ordered member identities rather than completion timing. Intermediate levels survive restart.

### Gates

Approval gates wait without occupying leases, runtimes, resource slots, or budget reservations. Decisions are versioned and checked transactionally. This is operationally sound.

### Budgets

Budget reservations occur in the same transaction as attempt admission. Actual or conservative usage is settled at completion. The implementation distinguishes task retry debt from infrastructure failures and supports block, fail, and approval policies.

These features demonstrate excellent reasoning about crash consistency. They are also evidence that the project has developed advanced control-plane machinery before providing an adequate general scientific task and artifact model.

## 11. Restricted execution

The restricted execution backend is unusually careful:

- exact digests for worker, launcher, Bubblewrap, protocol, and allowlisted tools;
- Bubblewrap namespaces;
- cleared environment;
- read-only bundle and input mounts;
- writable output directory and temporary filesystem;
- cgroup v2 memory, process, wall-time, and CPU enforcement;
- bounded request and response frames;
- parent-side verification of output paths, schemas, sizes, digests, symlinks, and hard links;
- cancellation through process-group and cgroup termination.

See [isolation] and [isolation-output-validation].

This is a strong Linux-local sandbox backend. It should be retained. It should not be the universal execution abstraction.

## 12. Operational observations

The branch derives a deterministic observation set from a terminal workflow run rather than maintaining mutable counters. The observation set includes:

- exact source and observation digests;
- retry-aware counts;
- elapsed time;
- queue-wait coverage;
- external-operation timing and coverage;
- accounting coverage;
- peak concurrency;
- artifact lineage;
- critical-path and failure traces;
- explicit coverage for boundaries that cannot be reconstructed.

The implementation refuses to invent timestamps when the durable schema lacks an exact eligibility boundary. That is scientifically and operationally preferable to reporting false precision. See [observations-guide], [observation-types], and [observation-contract].

---

# Part III — What is strong and should be retained

## 13. Clear authority separation

The strongest architectural decision is that authored plans cannot select host authority:

- database paths;
- artifact roots;
- implementation bytes;
- runtime modules;
- secrets;
- worker capacities.

A workflow describes desired work. The host decides what trusted implementations and capabilities are available. This prevents a workflow file from silently elevating itself into an operator configuration.

The clean executor should preserve this distinction:

```text
plan authority
  graph, parameters, declared capabilities, desired resources

host authority
  storage, credentials, worker pools, implementation admission,
  security policies, maximum resources, network policy
```

## 14. Exact implementation resolution

Pinning bundle bytes, entrypoint, ABI, modules, and executor identity is exactly the kind of provenance a scientific executor needs. Many workflow systems record only a command string and image tag; Workflow V3 already has the internal discipline to reject approximate matches.

This code can form the basis of a generalized task implementation identity:

```text
implementation_digest = hash(
  source bundle
  + command or entrypoint
  + runtime ABI
  + environment image or lockfile
  + capability profile
  + task contract
)
```

## 15. Correct attempt and lease semantics

The implementation makes a valuable distinction between:

- a logical node;
- an attempt;
- an infrastructure construction failure;
- a task failure;
- a lease loss;
- a cancellation;
- a stale completion.

A worker does not become authoritative merely because it started first. Authority is a leased, fenced database fact. This should be copied substantially intact into the clean executor.

## 16. Transactional resource and budget admission

Resource capacity and budget reservation are checked at admission time rather than after work begins. This matters for expensive model-provider calls, embedding services, and GPU jobs.

The current multidimensional integer budget model can be generalized to:

- requests;
- input tokens;
- output tokens;
- bytes transferred;
- cost microunits;
- GPU-seconds;
- CPU-seconds;
- storage-byte-hours.

The exact current budget UI is too prominent for a first release, but the transactional mechanism is valuable.

## 17. External-operation ledger

The external-operation model is one of the most reusable parts of the branch. A trusted host module admits an effect before it begins and records a bounded completion afterward. The record includes:

- operation kind and version;
- authority digest;
- descriptor digest;
- optional correlation digest;
- reservation and measure counters;
- provider start and elapsed time;
- outcome and closed failure class/code;
- actual, conservative, or absent accounting.

See [external-operations].

For RAG this can represent:

- embedding API calls;
- LLM summary generation;
- synthetic-question generation;
- reranking API calls;
- answer generation;
- judge-model evaluations;
- remote vector-database operations.

The model correctly avoids placing arbitrary provider error text, credentials, or request/response bodies in the operational ledger. Raw or encrypted provider evidence, when required, should be separate policy-controlled artifacts.

## 18. Honest derived observations

The observation projector’s use of explicit coverage is a model worth retaining. A derived metric should say not only its value, but which source boundaries were actually observable.

For example:

```yaml
metric: executor.queue_wait
value: 12400
unit: microseconds
coverage:
  observed: 1800
  total: 2000
```

This is more trustworthy than silently treating unobservable queue waits as zero.

## 19. Secure output publication

The parent process revalidates outputs before publishing them into artifact custody. It does not trust a child-reported digest or path. Traversal, symlinks, hard links, unexpected files, unexpected ports, size violations, and digest drift are rejected.

This is the correct direction for all executor backends, including containers and remote workers.

---

# Part IV — Critical gaps for RAG experimentation

## 20. There is no first-class node parameter model

This is the most important semantic omission.

The reviewed task and node contracts contain:

- implementation identity;
- input bindings;
- output schemas;
- modules;
- resource class;
- retry policy;
- budget policy;
- isolation policy.

They do not contain:

- a parameter object;
- a parameter schema;
- a parameter digest;
- defaults;
- sensitive versus nonsensitive parameter fields;
- scientific versus execution parameter roles.

The JavaScript descriptor loader treats the descriptor options object as input ports and rejects unknown fields. See [workflow-types] and [authoring].

For a RAG workflow, parameters are not incidental. A chunk task needs values such as:

```yaml
method: structural
sizeTokens: 512
overlapTokens: 64
preserveHeadings: true
```

A retrieval task needs:

```yaml
kind: hybrid
lexicalTopK: 100
vectorTopK: 100
fusion: rrf
rrfK: 60
finalTopK: 20
```

Under the current model, the author must choose among undesirable workarounds:

1. create a different task kind/version for every parameter combination;
2. encode parameters in a separate input artifact;
3. hide parameters inside an opaque native module or task source;
4. compile generated task packages into the binary.

All four weaken clarity or iteration speed.

### Required correction

Every node needs an immutable, schema-validated parameter object:

```yaml
parametersSchema: rag/chunk-parameters/v1
parameters:
  method: structural
  sizeTokens: 512
  overlapTokens: 64
```

The canonical parameter bytes must participate in the step execution fingerprint.

## 21. Task packages require Go composition and binary rebuilds

The current package system is not a scientist-facing package system.

A task package is a Go interface. Its JavaScript files are embedded with `//go:embed`; its manifest is constructed in Go; descriptor modules are registered in Go; required native modules are selected in Go; and the product composition root hardcodes the available packages. See [cookbook-package] and [package-composition].

This means a scientist cannot naturally create:

```text
rag_tasks/
  task-package.yaml
  chunk.py
  embed.py
  retrieve.py
```

and run it. They need repository changes and a rebuilt executable, or a separate integration repository that implements Go interfaces.

This is a fundamental product mismatch.

### Required correction

Task packages must be data packages, distributable as:

- a local directory;
- an immutable tar or zip bundle;
- an OCI artifact;
- a signed registry object;
- a content-addressed source bundle.

A package manifest should be sufficient:

```yaml
schemaVersion: research-executor-task-package/v1
name: rag-reference-tasks
version: 1.4.0

tasks:
  - id: rag.chunk/v1
    runtime:
      kind: container
      image: ghcr.io/example/rag-tasks@sha256:...
      command: [python, -m, rag_tasks.chunk]
    inputs:
      corpus: rag/document-set/v1
    parametersSchema: rag/chunk-parameters/v1
    outputs:
      chunks: rag/chunk-set/v1
```

Loading that manifest must not require compiling the executor.

## 22. The scripting language is wrong for the target audience

The custom JavaScript task runtime is elegant for trusted internal modules, but it is not the natural center of an ML research executor.

The target users already have:

- Python packages and virtual environments;
- PyTorch, Transformers, NumPy, pandas, FAISS, and vector-database clients;
- R analysis scripts;
- shell tools;
- Docker or OCI images;
- notebooks converted into scripts;
- compiled indexers and evaluation binaries.

Requiring those users to port work into Goja CommonJS and capability-specific native modules introduces friction without improving scientific clarity.

### Required correction

The universal task interface should be language-neutral and file-based:

```text
attempt/
  request.json
  inputs/
  work/
  outputs/
  result.json
  logs/
    stdout.log
    stderr.log
```

The executor launches an ordinary command or container. The task reads `request.json`, reads immutable input paths, writes outputs, and writes a bounded terminal result manifest.

SDKs may improve ergonomics for Python, R, JavaScript, Go, or Rust, but no SDK should be required.

The existing Goja runtime can remain as an optimized trusted backend for internal tasks.

## 23. Artifact handling is far too small and memory-oriented

The local artifact store defaults to 64 MiB per artifact. `Put` accepts a complete `[]byte`; `Open` calls `os.ReadFile`; input staging and restricted-output publication read complete artifacts into memory. See [artifact-store], [isolation], and [isolation-output-validation].

The Researchctl bridge tightens the practical limits further:

- 32 MiB request limit;
- 16 MiB export limit by default;
- artifact and domain-output payloads embedded as `[]byte` in JSON frames;
- set inputs encoded as an archive containing every item’s bytes.

See [research-runner-types], [research-runner], and [research-runner-export].

This cannot support realistic RAG artifacts such as:

- multi-gigabyte document snapshots;
- Parquet chunk datasets;
- embedding matrices;
- FAISS or HNSW index directories;
- model checkpoints;
- large traces or query-result tables;
- millions of set members.

Content-addressing the bytes does not solve transport and memory scaling.

### Required correction

The artifact API needs streaming and tree semantics:

```go
type ArtifactStore interface {
    PutStream(ctx context.Context, meta ArtifactMetadata, r io.Reader) (ArtifactRef, error)
    ImportFile(ctx context.Context, meta ArtifactMetadata, path string) (ArtifactRef, error)
    ImportTree(ctx context.Context, manifest TreeManifest, root string) (ArtifactRef, error)
    Open(ctx context.Context, ref ArtifactRef) (io.ReadCloser, error)
    OpenRange(ctx context.Context, ref ArtifactRef, offset, length int64) (io.ReadCloser, error)
}
```

It also needs:

- S3-compatible and other object-store backends;
- multipart uploads;
- directory/tree artifacts;
- range reads;
- server-side copy;
- local cache and data locality;
- integrity repair and verification;
- retention and garbage collection;
- sensitive-data classification.

The content identity should be separate from the current storage locator. The locator is a custody binding, not part of scientific content identity.

## 24. There is no cross-run step cache

The reviewed schema and runtime implement durable retries inside one workflow run, but not reuse of successful steps across workflow runs.

The content-addressed store deduplicates identical output bytes. It does not prevent the computation from being executed again. A new run creates new node rows and attempts for every node.

This is fatal for a large RAG experiment matrix.

Consider 300 cases that share:

- the same corpus parse;
- one of three chunk configurations;
- one of two embedding models;
- one of six index configurations;
- many downstream retrieval and answer configurations.

Without cross-run caching, the executor repeatedly parses, chunks, embeds, and builds indexes. The expensive shared structure of the study is lost.

### Required correction

Introduce a distinct step execution fingerprint and cache record:

```text
step_fingerprint = hash(
  task implementation digest
  + environment digest
  + canonical parameters
  + input artifact digests
  + relevant secret-version identities
  + deterministic seed
  + executor semantics version
  + compatibility class
)
```

A cache lookup may return verified outputs from a successful prior step. The new workflow still records a new step-run occurrence:

```yaml
status: materialized
cacheRecord: CACHE-...
producerStepRun: STEP-...
verifiedAt: ...
```

A cache hit is not the same thing as a resumed attempt and not the same thing as a scientific replicate.

## 25. Execution-environment identity is incomplete

Workflow V3 strongly pins task bundle bytes and, for the restricted executor, the worker, launcher, Bubblewrap, protocol, and allowlisted executable bytes. This is good.

It does not yet provide a general environment contract for:

- OCI image digest;
- Python lockfile or environment digest;
- system libraries;
- CUDA runtime and driver compatibility;
- model-runtime versions;
- locale and timezone;
- CPU architecture features;
- GPU type and firmware;
- environment-variable allowlist;
- mounted datasets and toolchains.

Trusted in-process tasks run inside the worker’s Goja process and depend on the worker’s native-module implementation. Restricted tasks get a carefully controlled sandbox, but the available tools are fixed host executables rather than a full portable environment.

### Required correction

Every step implementation needs an explicit environment identity:

```yaml
environment:
  kind: oci
  imageDigest: sha256:...
  platform: linux/amd64
  runtimeClass: nvidia
  driverCompatibility: cuda>=12.4
```

or:

```yaml
environment:
  kind: lockfile
  manager: uv
  lockDigest: sha256:...
  python: 3.13.2
```

The resolved environment identity must be stored with every attempt.

## 26. The resource model is too weak

The primary scheduling resource abstraction is a string resource class with an integer capacity:

```text
cpu.default = 4
cpu.isolated = 2
```

Isolation policies add limits, but the scheduler still lacks structured placement requirements for:

- CPU count;
- memory;
- scratch space;
- GPU count and model;
- minimum GPU memory;
- accelerator capability;
- network class;
- provider concurrency;
- object-store locality;
- index locality;
- NUMA and CPU architecture;
- ephemeral versus persistent disk.

A RAG pipeline requires different placements:

- chunking: CPU and memory;
- summarization: provider quota or inference GPU;
- embeddings: batched GPU or provider quota;
- vector-index build: memory, CPU, and scratch disk;
- answer generation: provider or inference GPU;
- evaluation: mixed CPU/GPU/provider resources.

### Required correction

Use structured requests and worker capabilities:

```yaml
resources:
  cpu: 8
  memoryBytes: 34359738368
  scratchBytes: 107374182400
  accelerators:
    - kind: nvidia.com/gpu
      count: 1
      minMemoryBytes: 25769803776
  networkClass: provider-egress
  locality:
    preferArtifacts: [sha256:...]
```

Resource classes may remain convenient aliases, but they cannot be the only scheduling model.

## 27. Local SQLite and local CAS define the practical deployment boundary

The current product is a good local durable executor:

- one SQLite database;
- one artifact directory;
- several local processes sharing those paths;
- a small number of SQLite connections;
- polling-based wakeups.

This is appropriate for a workstation or one shared filesystem host. It is not a general distributed executor.

Missing production-scale capabilities include:

- remote worker registration and heartbeats;
- authenticated task leasing over a service API;
- PostgreSQL or another shared control store;
- remote object storage;
- tenant and project authorization;
- queue priorities;
- cluster schedulers;
- worker labels and capabilities;
- network partitions;
- artifact locality and transfer planning.

These should not all be built immediately. The architecture should nevertheless avoid making local paths and SQLite locators part of the universal contract.

## 28. Map semantics will not scale naively to corpus-level items

The lazy map implementation is careful and deterministic. The default authoring policy, however, allows 10,000 items and materializes a durable node and database state per item. The documented tests exercise thousands, not millions, of items. See [authoring] and [runtime-guide].

A real corpus can contain:

- millions of chunks;
- hundreds of thousands of enrichment requests;
- tens of thousands of evaluation questions;
- repeated answer and judge samples.

One durable workflow node per chunk or query may generate prohibitive database and scheduling overhead.

### Required correction

The executor needs explicit sharding and batch-map semantics:

```yaml
scatter:
  source: chunks
  partition:
    targetItems: 512
    targetBytes: 67108864
    preserveKeyOrder: true
```

A task processes a shard and returns a shard artifact. Item-level lineage remains in the manifest or output table rather than requiring one control-plane node per item.

Fine-grained map nodes should remain available for tasks that genuinely need item-level retry and side-effect accounting.

## 29. General conditional execution and branch boundaries are missing

Approval gates support a decision point, but the runtime guide explicitly notes that rejection or expiry currently fails the run because explicit branch boundaries do not exist.

Scientific and ML workflows commonly need:

- skip when an artifact already passes validation;
- choose a CPU or GPU branch;
- run a repair path after quality-control failure;
- conditionally build a lexical or vector index;
- stop an adaptive stage after a budget or outcome threshold;
- continue unrelated outputs after one optional branch fails.

The clean executor needs explicit conditional nodes and scoped failure boundaries. It should avoid arbitrary dynamic control flow, but a typed expression over prior results is necessary.

## 30. There is no first-class task checkpoint model

A task can observe cancellation and the workflow preserves completed nodes. That is not the same as checkpointing a long task.

Index construction, model training, large embedding jobs, and corpus processing may need:

- periodic checkpoint artifacts;
- resumable uploads;
- restart from a checkpoint after preemption;
- continuation identity;
- policies determining whether a checkpoint is compatible with a new attempt.

Checkpoints should be explicit artifacts with a compatibility contract, not mutable files hidden in a worker directory.

## 31. Logs and debugging evidence are underdeveloped

The design intentionally avoids arbitrary error text in durable operational rows. That is sensible for bounded privacy-safe projections.

It does not eliminate the need for diagnostic evidence. In the restricted executor, stderr is bounded and discarded. The task result contract does not expose first-class stdout, stderr, structured logs, or diagnostic bundles.

For scientific reproducibility and operations, the executor should preserve:

- sanitized stdout and stderr artifacts;
- structured task logs;
- environment-resolution logs;
- resource-usage summaries;
- provider request identifiers;
- stack traces under access policy;
- a privacy-safe failure projection for ordinary status views.

The public read model can remain redacted while authorized users inspect the underlying diagnostic artifacts.

## 32. Canonicalization is implementation-local rather than interoperable

`CanonicalJSON` currently calls Go’s `json.Marshal` and hashes the result. This is deterministic for the current Go-produced data structures, but it is not a named cross-language canonicalization contract and the digest functions are not domain-separated. See [canonical].

For a workflow ecosystem involving Python, Go, R, containers, and external services, identity must not depend on one language runtime’s serialization conventions.

### Required correction

Adopt an explicit canonical JSON specification, reject noncanonical numeric values, normalize Unicode as required by the chosen standard, and domain-separate every identity:

```text
sha256("research-executor:plan:v1\0" + canonical_json(plan))
sha256("research-executor:step:v1\0" + canonical_json(step_fingerprint))
sha256("research-executor:artifact-tree:v1\0" + canonical_json(tree))
```

## 33. The operational database is not an immutable scientific ledger

The documentation sometimes uses “immutable” broadly. The SQLite schema contains mutable state columns and `ON DELETE CASCADE` relationships. Attempt rows transition from running to terminal status. This is correct for an operational executor.

It should be described accurately:

- workflow plans and content digests are immutable values;
- attempt identities and outcomes are append-preserving;
- operational rows are transactionally controlled and fenced;
- the database itself is not a cryptographically immutable audit ledger.

Researchctl 2 should ingest or reference terminal execution records and anchor them in the study’s provenance package. The executor does not need to pretend its mutable scheduler database is the permanent scientific record.

---

# Part V — User experience and overengineering

## 34. New-user mental model

A new scientist encounters:

- the `scraper` product name, despite using it as a generic workflow executor;
- a custom CommonJS workflow language;
- descriptor-only task modules;
- implementation task modules;
- Go-embedded task packages;
- a sealed registry and catalog digest;
- resource classes;
- retry policies;
- isolation maximums and effective policies;
- lazy maps and bounded reductions;
- budgets and approval gates;
- a local SQLite store and artifact root;
- a separate worker process;
- canonical observation projection;
- an optional HTTP service;
- a separate Researchctl runner and domain config.

Each concept can be justified internally. The combined first-use experience is not acceptable for a scientist who wants to run `chunk.py`, `embed.py`, and `evaluate.py`.

The product needs a progressive surface:

```text
Level 1: run an ordinary command or container
Level 2: connect commands into a typed DAG
Level 3: configure retries, resources, caching, and scatter
Level 4: external operations, budgets, gates, and custom policies
Level 5: executor development and registry operations
```

Currently, Levels 3–5 are structurally central before Level 1 exists.

## 35. Features that are advanced but not inherently wrong

The following features are not mistakes:

- rolling registry generations;
- quarantine after repeated runtime-construction failures;
- transactional budgets;
- approval gates;
- external-operation accounting;
- deterministic lazy maps;
- deterministic reductions;
- restricted subprocess isolation;
- canonical operational observations.

They become overengineering because they arrived before:

- normal task parameters;
- Python and container tasks;
- streaming artifacts;
- cross-run caching;
- environment manifests;
- a portable task-package format;
- large-scale data movement.

The implementation sequence optimized for difficult invariants rather than user value. This has produced excellent reusable internals and an unbalanced product.

## 36. Duplication in the current Researchctl integration

The current bridge creates two nested execution systems:

```text
Researchctl run
  -> Researchctl attempt
      -> scraper-workflow-runner process
          -> Scraper workflow run
              -> Scraper nodes
                  -> Scraper attempts
                      -> external operations
```

It also creates two artifact stores and copies selected Scraper outputs back through Researchctl’s bounded frame protocol.

This produces:

- two run identity systems;
- two attempt identity systems;
- two event systems;
- two artifact custody systems;
- two retry layers;
- two cancellation layers;
- duplicated metric projection;
- copied artifacts;
- complex cross-system failure classification.

The bridge is carefully implemented and the lineage is explicit. The architecture is still too indirect.

## 37. Controller retries can duplicate executor workflows

The runner intentionally creates one Scraper workflow per Researchctl attempt. If the process crashes, a later Researchctl attempt creates a new workflow and does not adopt the earlier one. See [research-runner-guide] and [research-runner].

This is honest, but it can repeat:

- provider calls;
- index builds;
- external writes;
- expensive GPU work.

The external-operation ledger preserves evidence of ambiguity but does not itself make the operation exactly once.

### Required correction

The clean controller-to-executor API should support idempotent submission and reconnection:

```text
idempotency_key = hash(
  research_run_id
  + executor_plan_digest
  + execution_generation
)
```

Submitting the same key returns the existing executor run. A controller restart reconnects to that run. A scientifically intentional rerun uses a new key and records the parent relation.

Operational attempts inside the executor remain independent from scientific run occurrences in Researchctl.

# Part VI — How the current executor maps to a RAG pipeline

## 38. What can be modeled today

A RAG workflow can theoretically use current primitives as follows:

| RAG phase | Current Workflow V3 primitive |
|---|---|
| Parse corpus | Static task |
| Chunk corpus | Static task or map over documents |
| Generate summaries | Lazy map over chunk manifest |
| Generate questions | Lazy map over chunk manifest |
| Aggregate enrichments | Reduction or task consuming output manifest |
| Embed chunks | Map over chunks or batches |
| Build vector index | Static task |
| Build lexical index | Static task |
| Retrieve queries | Map over evaluation questions |
| Rerank | Map task |
| Answer | Map task |
| Evaluate | Map plus reduction |
| Provider calls | Trusted host module plus external-operation recorder |
| Cost limits | Budget accounts |
| Human approval | Gate |
| CPU/GPU separation | Resource-class aliases |

This demonstrates that the executor has a plausible structural core.

## 39. Where the mapping fails in practice

### Chunking variants

There is no first-class parameter object for chunk size, overlap, tokenizer, or method. The scientist must encode configuration as an input artifact or produce separate task descriptors.

### Summary and question generation

Provider access requires a trusted Go native module. Adding an OpenAI, Anthropic, local-vLLM, or custom inference provider is not merely a Python dependency; it becomes executor integration code.

### Embeddings

A realistic embedding set exceeds the current artifact size and memory model. One-item-per-node maps create excessive scheduler overhead; large batches need explicit sharding.

### Indexes

Vector and lexical indexes are often directories or multiple files. The current artifact contract is one byte blob. Index construction may require hundreds of gigabytes of memory or scratch space that the resource model cannot express.

### Retrieval matrices

Hundreds of retrieval configurations need to reuse the same index artifacts. The current executor has no cross-run node cache.

### Answer generation

The executor can count provider operations and retries, but ordinary Python provider clients cannot directly use the external-operation recorder without a Go host module.

### Evaluation

Evaluation tables should be Parquet or similar large artifacts, not thousands of scalar frames. The fixed operational observation set is valuable but does not replace domain evaluation artifacts.

### Multi-case study compilation

Researchctl needs either:

1. one executor plan containing shared materializations for many assignments; or
2. multiple executor runs with a common cross-run cache.

The current one-plan-per-workflow-run model has neither study-aware coalescing nor cross-run caching.

## 40. Expected behavior in the clean system

Suppose the study includes:

- three chunking configurations;
- two enrichment modes;
- two embedding models;
- three vector-index configurations;
- four retrieval configurations;
- three answer configurations.

The naïve Cartesian product has 432 end-to-end cases.

The executor should recognize only the required unique upstream materializations:

```text
1 corpus parse
3 chunk sets
up to 6 enrichment sets
up to 6 embedding sets
up to 18 vector indexes
3 lexical indexes, if chunk-dependent
then downstream retrieval and answer materializations
```

Changing only the answer prompt must not recompute chunking, enrichment, embedding, indexing, or retrieval.

This is the central performance requirement for the executor beneath Researchctl 2.

---

# Part VII — Fundamental scripting shift

## 41. Separate workflow declaration from task implementation

The current system does this in principle, but both sides are custom JavaScript.

The clean system should have:

### Canonical execution plan

Portable JSON or YAML data:

```yaml
schemaVersion: research-executor-plan/v1
id: rag-case-17

steps:
  - id: chunks
    task: rag.chunk/v1
    implementation: sha256:...
    parameters:
      method: structural
      sizeTokens: 512
      overlapTokens: 64
    inputs:
      documents: artifact:sha256:...
    outputs:
      chunks: rag/chunk-set/v1
```

### Optional authoring compilers

- Python builder;
- YAML templates;
- JavaScript builder;
- domain-specific RAG compiler;
- import from CWL, Snakemake, or another system where appropriate.

The compiled plan is authoritative. The builder language is not.

## 42. Universal task process contract

A task should receive a bounded request:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "research-executor-task-request/v1",
  "executionId": "EXEC-...",
  "stepRunId": "STEP-...",
  "attempt": 1,
  "task": {
    "id": "rag.chunk/v1",
    "implementationDigest": "sha256:...",
    "environmentDigest": "sha256:..."
  },
  "parameters": {
    "method": "structural",
    "sizeTokens": 512,
    "overlapTokens": 64
  },
  "inputs": {
    "documents": {
      "digest": "sha256:...",
      "path": "/inputs/documents",
      "schema": "rag/document-set/v1"
    }
  },
  "outputDirectory": "/outputs"
}
```

It writes:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "research-executor-task-result/v1",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "outputs": {
    "chunks": {
      "path": "chunks.parquet",
      "schema": "rag/chunk-set/v1",
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.apache.parquet"
    }
  },
  "usage": {
    "cpuMicros": 9182300,
    "peakMemoryBytes": 1849921024
  }
}
```

The parent verifies and imports outputs. The process protocol never transports the output bytes.

## 43. Runtime backends

The task contract should be implemented by multiple backends:

1. **Local process** — ordinary executable in a controlled environment.
2. **OCI container** — primary reproducible execution path.
3. **Restricted Bubblewrap process** — retain current secure local backend.
4. **Trusted in-process runtime** — retain for small internal Goja tasks only.
5. **Slurm adapter** — HPC jobs.
6. **Kubernetes adapter** — remote containers.
7. **External workflow adapter** — optional delegation to a mature engine.

All backends must produce the same step-run and artifact contracts.

## 44. Task package manifest

A clean package can be built without Go:

```yaml
schemaVersion: research-executor-task-package/v1
name: rag-tasks
version: 2.1.0
source:
  repository: https://example.invalid/rag-tasks
  revision: 9a31d4...

implementations:
  - task: rag.embed/v1
    environment:
      kind: oci
      image: ghcr.io/example/rag-tasks@sha256:...
    command: [python, -m, rag_tasks.embed]
    parametersSchema: schemas/embed-parameters-v1.json
    inputs:
      chunks: rag/chunk-set/v1
    outputs:
      embeddings: rag/embedding-set/v1
    resources:
      cpu: 4
      memoryBytes: 17179869184
      accelerators:
        - kind: nvidia.com/gpu
          count: 1
          minMemoryBytes: 17179869184
    cache:
      default: exact
```

The package itself receives a content digest. Signatures and admission policy can be added without making Go compilation the packaging mechanism.

## 45. Python ergonomics without Python authority

A Python builder may compile the canonical plan:

```python
from research_executor import workflow
from rag_tasks import tasks

with workflow("rag-evaluation") as w:
    documents = w.input("documents", "rag/document-set/v1")

    chunks = w.step(
        "chunks",
        tasks.chunk,
        inputs={"documents": documents},
        parameters={
            "method": "structural",
            "sizeTokens": 512,
            "overlapTokens": 64,
        },
    )

    embeddings = w.step(
        "embeddings",
        tasks.embed,
        inputs={"chunks": chunks.output("chunks")},
        parameters={"model": "embed-large-v3"},
    )

w.write("plan.json")
```

The generated JSON is reviewed and hashed. The Python process does not execute the tasks and does not become part of the runtime authority unless its generated output changes.

```

## 47. Core records

### Execution plan

Prospective graph, task contracts, parameters, resources, and policies.

### Execution run

One operational occurrence created from a plan. It is not a scientific replicate by itself.

### Step run

One occurrence of one planned node in one execution run. It can be:

- pending;
- blocked;
- leased;
- running;
- succeeded;
- failed;
- canceled;
- materialized from cache;
- skipped by condition.

### Attempt

One operational try for a step run.

### Artifact record

Content identity, schema, media type, size, custody locations, producing step run, and parent inputs.

### Cache record

Successful fingerprint-to-output mapping with verification state and compatibility class.

### Materialization record

Evidence that a step run used a cache record instead of executing a task.

### External-operation record

The current Workflow V3 model, generalized and retained.

### Worker capability record

Backends, architectures, resources, environment support, isolation profiles, and locality.

## 48. State ownership

Researchctl 2 owns:

```text
study run status
assignment completion
scientific exclusions
replicate validity
analysis inclusion
```

The executor owns:

```text
execution run status
step dependencies
step attempts
leases
resource admission
artifact publication
cache materialization
external operations
```

Researchctl may mark a scientific run failed even if the executor technically succeeded, for example because a quality-control criterion failed. The executor should not interpret that decision.

## 49. Idempotent execution API

Minimum API:

```text
SubmitExecution(idempotency_key, plan_digest, bindings)
GetExecution(execution_id)
FollowExecution(execution_id, after_sequence)
CancelExecution(execution_id, expected_version)
RetryStep(step_run_id, reason)
ListArtifacts(execution_id)
VerifyExecution(execution_id)
```

`SubmitExecution` returns the existing execution when the idempotency key already exists with the same plan and bindings. It rejects conflicting reuse of the key.

This replaces the current nested stdio runner as the normal integration path.

## 50. Event model

Events should be durable, sequence-ordered, and reconnectable:

```text
execution.created
step.ready
step.leased
attempt.started
external_operation.admitted
external_operation.completed
artifact.published
attempt.failed
step.retry_scheduled
step.materialized
step.succeeded
execution.failed
execution.succeeded
execution.canceled
```

Events contain bounded identifiers and closed classifications. Large details are artifacts.

The current operational event and high-water sequence model provides a strong starting point.

## 51. Cache model

Cache lookup occurs only after all inputs and implementation identities are resolved.

```yaml
cachePolicy:
  mode: exact
  onMissing: execute
  onCorrupt: execute-and-quarantine
```

A cache record is reusable only when:

- the producer step succeeded;
- every required output exists;
- each output digest and size verifies;
- the complete fingerprint matches;
- policy allows reuse;
- data-access policy permits the current study to read it.

Failed or canceled attempts never create cache records.

## 52. Artifact model

Recommended split:

```yaml
content:
  digest: sha256:...
  sizeBytes: ...
  mediaType: ...
  logicalSchema: rag/vector-index/v1

custody:
  locations:
    - store: lab-s3
      uri: s3://.../objects/...
  verifiedAt: ...

lineage:
  producedBy: STEP-...
  inputs: [sha256:..., sha256:...]
```

The content object is portable. Custody locations can change without changing the content identity.

## 53. Resource scheduler

Retain the transactionally fenced lease model, but schedule against structured resource vectors and worker capabilities.

The scheduler should initially support:

- local resource pools;
- fixed priorities;
- per-project concurrency;
- CPU, memory, scratch, and GPU requirements;
- provider-operation quota pools;
- artifact locality preference.

Preemption and complex fair sharing can wait.

## 54. Security model

### Default

User tasks execute outside the coordinator process.

### Process/container environment

- clean environment;
- explicit variable allowlist;
- secret handles rather than values in plans;
- read-only inputs;
- writable attempt outputs;
- no control-database credentials;
- no artifact-store write authority beyond a scoped staging capability;
- network disabled unless declared and authorized.

### Backends

- OCI is the primary portability boundary;
- Bubblewrap/cgroup remains an excellent local restricted backend;
- trusted in-process Goja is limited to signed internal packages;
- remote workers authenticate and receive short-lived scoped capabilities.

### Operator API

The current HTTP API uses one bearer token only for cancellation while read endpoints are unauthenticated. That is acceptable for a loopback development service. A shared service needs authenticated reads, tenant authorization, audit records, and TLS. See [operator-http].

# Part IX — Researchctl 2 integration

## 55. Replace nested custody with explicit composition

The clean integration should be:

```text
Researchctl scientific run
  -> Executor execution run
      -> step runs
          -> attempts
              -> external operations
```

Researchctl stores:

- executor execution ID;
- plan digest;
- submission idempotency key;
- terminal executor record digest;
- referenced output artifact digests;
- relevant operational observation digest.

The executor stores its own operational state. Artifacts live in a shared or federated artifact service. They are referenced, not copied through process frames.

## 56. Retry ownership

Researchctl decides whether to create a new scientific run occurrence.

The executor decides whether to retry a failed operational attempt according to the compiled step policy.

```text
same step run + new attempt
  operational retry

new Researchctl run + new executor execution
  scientific or operator-requested re-execution
```

A controller process restart is neither. It reconnects to the same executor run.

## 57. Artifact ownership

The executor publishes step artifacts into custody. Researchctl registers or references the resulting content identities as evidence.

Avoid:

- copying all workflow outputs into a second artifact root;
- changing names or packaging solely for the bridge;
- embedding artifacts in NDJSON;
- pretending the executor’s local locator is a portable identifier.

## 58. Operational versus scientific observations

The current canonical workflow observations should be retained as executor observations:

```text
executor.elapsed
executor.attempts
executor.retries
executor.queue_wait
executor.external_operations.*
executor.accounting.coverage
```

RAG domain results should normally be typed artifacts:

- retrieval metrics table;
- answer evaluation table;
- per-query traces;
- citation correctness table;
- cost and latency table.

Small scalar summaries may be projected for dashboards, but the artifact remains the authoritative analysis input.

## 59. Terminal execution record

At terminal state, the executor should publish a compact signed or digested record:

```yaml
schemaVersion: research-executor-terminal-record/v1
executionId: EXEC-...
planDigest: sha256:...
status: succeeded
createdAt: ...
terminalAt: ...
steps:
  total: 41
  succeeded: 30
  materialized: 11
  failed: 0
attempts: 33
outputs:
  retrievalResults: sha256:...
  answers: sha256:...
observationsDigest: sha256:...
eventHighWater: 812
recordDigest: sha256:...
```

Researchctl references this record in the scientific run ledger.

# Part X — Implementation assessment

## 60. Code quality strengths

The implementation shows strong engineering discipline in several areas:

- strict JSON decoding;
- closed status and failure vocabularies;
- exact bundle and implementation identities;
- defensive path handling;
- output re-verification;
- transactional lease and budget admission;
- cancellation epochs and stale-completion fencing;
- deterministic map and reduction identities;
- fresh Goja runtimes per attempt;
- infrastructure-failure quarantine separated from semantic retry debt;
- deterministic observation projection;
- coverage instead of invented values;
- fuzz and adversarial tests for protocol and filesystem boundaries.

Representative tests cover malformed frames, traversal, symlink and hard-link attacks, digest drift, resource limits, and cancellation. See [isolation-tests].

## 61. Code and maintenance concerns

### Too many responsibilities in one product

The repository includes:

- a workflow language;
- compiler;
- task package manager;
- JavaScript runtime;
- capability module system;
- scheduler;
- database;
- artifact store;
- map/reduce engine;
- budget system;
- approval system;
- external-effect ledger;
- sandbox runtime;
- operator API;
- Researchctl bridge;
- legacy scraping product.

Even if the packages are separated, this makes conceptual and release boundaries difficult.

### Custom contract duplication

Several layers carry related but separate representations:

- IR task references;
- compiled plan nodes;
- bundle task specs;
- registered task specs;
- JavaScript descriptor objects;
- Researchctl domain configs;
- Researchctl runner wire types.

Some duplication is necessary for compilation. The current amount increases drift risk.

### Migration strategy

The SQLite store executes `schema.sql` and applies additive-column migrations at open. A mature shared executor needs explicit migration versions, transactional upgrade tests, rollback or backup guidance, compatibility windows, and fixture databases from previous releases.

### Memory scaling

`os.ReadFile`, `[]byte`, and full-body canonical JSON are pervasive in artifact and bridge paths. This will become a reliability issue before CPU scheduling does.

### Platform assumptions

The strongest isolation path assumes Linux, Bubblewrap, and delegated cgroup v2. That is acceptable as one backend but should not leak into the universal plan contract.

## 62. Test and CI assessment

The repository workflow runs:

- generated-asset checks;
- logger-generation checks;
- `go test ./...`.

See [ci].

The runtime guide documents additional race, restart, integration, and cross-repository smoke testing. Those claims are encouraging, but the standard CI workflow does not visibly include:

- `go test -race`;
- large-artifact tests;
- multi-gigabyte streaming tests;
- PostgreSQL or remote-store tests;
- container runtime tests;
- GPU scheduling tests;
- cross-run cache tests, because caching does not exist;
- the Researchctl cross-repository smoke as a CI job.

The push workflow is restricted to `main` plus pull requests. A branch push alone is not sufficient evidence that this branch passed CI.

## 63. Maturity judgment

The code is more mature than the user-facing product. It contains many implementation-level safeguards one would expect in a production kernel.

It remains a prototype in product terms because:

- the only builtin packages are fixtures/cookbook components;
- the general task packaging path is absent;
- artifact scale is deliberately small;
- deployment is local;
- the scientific integration is a bespoke bridge;
- the architecture has not yet been validated against a complete real RAG workload at production data size.

---

# Part XI — What to copy, what to rewrite, what to defer

## 64. Copy or adapt substantially

- lease tokens and cancellation epochs;
- stale-completion rejection;
- attempt numbering and retry state transitions;
- exact implementation matching;
- bundle/source digest logic, after upgrading canonicalization;
- strict compiler validation patterns;
- deterministic map child identities;
- deterministic reduction partition identities;
- resource and budget admission transaction patterns;
- external-operation admission/completion model;
- output path and digest verification;
- registry-generation acquisition semantics for long-running workers;
- infrastructure-failure quarantine concept;
- operational observation projector and coverage model;
- adversarial filesystem and protocol tests;
- Bubblewrap/cgroup backend as an optional executor.

## 65. Rewrite

- task package loading;
- task parameter model;
- task process protocol;
- artifact store interface;
- environment identity;
- resource requests;
- cross-run caching;
- controller integration;
- logs and diagnostics;
- canonicalization and digest domain separation;
- public CLI and configuration;
- HTTP/shared-service authentication;
- run export and interoperability.

## 66. Remove from the primary scientist path

- Goja module-development concepts;
- registry generations;
- executor digests;
- budget reservation internals;
- gate CAS internals;
- map page and reduction-level tuning;
- database and lease flags;
- Researchctl stdio frame details.

These remain operator or developer concepts.

## 67. Defer

Until ordinary tasks, caching, and large artifacts work:

- arbitrary adaptive workflow mutation;
- complex preemption;
- multi-tenant fair sharing;
- broad plugin systems;
- visual workflow IDEs;
- general-purpose approval branching;
- automatic cloud provisioning;
- executor-owned scientific analysis.

---

# Part XII — Phased redesign roadmap

## 68. Phase 0: freeze the kernel contracts

Define and test:

- plan canonicalization;
- task package manifest;
- node parameters;
- environment identity;
- resource request;
- step fingerprint;
- artifact content and custody separation;
- execution, step-run, attempt, cache, and materialization state machines;
- external-operation contract;
- terminal execution record;
- controller idempotency contract.

Do not implement a new UI during this phase.

## 69. Phase 1: ordinary local tasks

Deliver:

- command task backend;
- OCI container backend;
- file-based task request/result contract;
- stdout/stderr artifacts;
- explicit environment allowlist;
- streaming local CAS;
- file and tree artifacts;
- typed parameter schemas;
- simple DAG execution;
- current lease and retry semantics.

Acceptance scenario:

```text
Python parse -> Python chunk -> Python embed -> Python evaluate
```

No Go code or executor rebuild is required to add the tasks.

## 70. Phase 2: exact cross-run cache

Deliver:

- step fingerprints;
- successful cache records;
- output verification before reuse;
- materialization events;
- cache inspection and invalidation quarantine;
- access-policy checks;
- deterministic random seed capture.

Acceptance scenario:

- change only answer prompt;
- prove parse, chunk, embedding, index, and retrieval are materialized rather than executed;
- still create complete occurrence provenance for the new scientific run.

## 71. Phase 3: RAG-scale artifacts and scatter

Deliver:

- object-store backend;
- multipart upload;
- range reads;
- directory/tree artifacts;
- Parquet manifest conventions;
- batch scatter and gather;
- data-locality hints;
- million-item metadata benchmark without million control-plane nodes.

Acceptance scenario:

- multi-gigabyte corpus;
- multi-gigabyte embeddings;
- directory vector index;
- tens of thousands of evaluation questions.

## 72. Phase 4: structured resources and remote execution

Deliver:

- CPU/memory/scratch/GPU requests;
- worker capability advertisements;
- local and remote worker protocol;
- PostgreSQL control store;
- authenticated service API;
- OCI workers;
- one Slurm or Kubernetes adapter;
- remote artifact credentials scoped per attempt.

## 73. Phase 5: Researchctl 2 integration

Deliver:

- idempotent submit/reconnect;
- study-run to execution-run linkage;
- terminal-record ingestion;
- shared artifact references;
- cancellation and re-execution policy;
- executor observations;
- RO-Crate/PROV export hooks.

Remove the nested stdio bridge from the authoritative path.

## 74. Phase 6: advanced retained features

Port or expose, in order:

1. external-operation accounting;
2. budget policies;
3. approval gates;
4. rolling registries;
5. conditional branches;
6. checkpoint continuation;
7. complex distributed scheduling.

Each feature should be justified by a real workflow rather than by internal completeness.

---

# Part XIII — Required test strategy for the clean executor

## 75. State-machine tests

For every execution, step, and attempt transition:

- allowed predecessor states;
- idempotent retry behavior;
- stale version rejection;
- cancellation races;
- lease expiry;
- worker crash;
- coordinator crash;
- duplicate completion;
- cache materialization races.

## 76. Artifact tests

- streaming multi-gigabyte file without full memory load;
- tree artifacts;
- traversal, symlink, hard-link, and device-file rejection;
- interrupted multipart upload;
- server-side copy;
- digest corruption detection;
- custody relocation without content-identity change;
- concurrent identical uploads;
- garbage-collection reachability.

## 77. Cache tests

- parameter change invalidates;
- code change invalidates;
- environment change invalidates;
- input digest change invalidates;
- execution-only scheduling change does not invalidate, where policy says so;
- failed and canceled attempts never populate cache;
- missing output invalidates a record;
- corrupted output quarantines a record;
- concurrent identical steps execute once or resolve deterministically;
- a cache hit records new materialization provenance.

## 78. RAG vertical-slice tests

At minimum:

- multiple chunk configurations;
- summary/question enrichment;
- embedding model alternatives;
- lexical, vector, and hybrid retrieval;
- reranking;
- answer generation;
- evaluation;
- upstream sharing across cases;
- provider retry and accounting;
- index tree artifacts;
- GPU and CPU placement;
- controller restart and executor reconnection;
- deterministic study snapshot.

## 79. Failure-injection tests

Kill processes:

- before lease persistence;
- after lease but before task launch;
- during provider operation;
- after task side effect but before completion;
- after output file write but before publication;
- after artifact publication but before step completion;
- after step completion but before controller acknowledgement.

Every outcome must be explainable from durable evidence.

## 80. Performance tests

Measure:

- one million logical item records represented in batched manifests;
- thousands of simultaneous ready steps;
- large artifact upload and range read;
- SQLite local mode limits;
- PostgreSQL remote mode;
- event-follow reconnection;
- cache lookup scale;
- artifact-locality scheduling;
- CPU overhead per short task;
- provider-operation throughput.

---

# Final conclusion

Workflow V3 answers many difficult questions correctly:

- Who currently owns an attempt?
- Can a stale worker publish?
- Which exact implementation was selected?
- What happens after a worker crash?
- How are retries distinguished from logical work?
- How are outputs verified?
- How are external effects admitted and accounted?
- Which derived timing boundaries are actually observable?

Those are valuable achievements.

It does not yet answer the more basic questions a RAG scientist asks:

- How do I run my existing Python program?
- Where do I declare chunk size, model, `top_k`, and prompt parameters?
- Which environment and GPU produced this result?
- How do I store a 40 GB index?
- Why is an unchanged embedding job running again?
- How do I add a task without modifying Go code?
- How do I reconnect after the controller restarts?
- How do I execute locally, in a container, on Slurm, or on Kubernetes with the same plan?

The clean system should therefore retain Workflow V3’s **execution invariants**, not its current **scripting and packaging assumptions**.

The recommended target is:

> A language-neutral, artifact-first, cache-aware, parameterized execution service with durable leases and attempts, exact implementation and environment identity, ordinary process/container tasks, streaming local or remote custody, structured resources, and an idempotent integration API for Researchctl 2.

In that architecture, the current branch becomes a highly informative prototype and a substantial library of proven mechanisms—not the final scientist-facing executor.

[Download both Researchctl 2 documents as a ZIP](sandbox:/mnt/data/researchctl2_rag_architecture_and_executor_review.zip)

The document is approximately 1,850 lines and evaluates the executor against the RAG research program from the first architecture guide.

## Main conclusion

**Workflow V3 should not be discarded. It should not be adopted unchanged either.**

Its durable execution kernel is materially stronger and cleaner than the current Researchctl implementation. The transactional leases, append-only attempts, cancellation fencing, typed failures, work-conserving dispatcher, bounded maps and reductions, external-operation accounting, deterministic observation projection, and restricted process isolation are all worth extracting. The implementation is unusually defensive for a prototype. fileciteturn111file0L77-L101 fileciteturn129file0L115-L153 fileciteturn134file0L133-L203

The current product still fails several requirements that are essential for our RAG experiment system.

### 1. It cannot efficiently execute an experiment matrix

The Researchctl bridge creates a separate SQLite database and artifact root from each Researchctl run/attempt identity. A subsequent Researchctl attempt therefore starts in another isolated workflow store. fileciteturn147file0L124-L164

The reviewed plan, runtime, and database model contain no global step-materialization cache. Consequently, compatible experiment cases cannot safely share:

- parsed corpora;
- chunk sets;
- generated summaries;
- synthetic-question sets;
- embedding sets;
- lexical or vector indexes;
- retrieval candidate tables;
- reranked contexts.

For a RAG study, this is the largest architectural mismatch. The executor is optimized for the correctness of one isolated workflow occurrence, while the research program requires provenance-preserving reuse across many scientific occurrences.

### 2. The artifact data plane is too small

The artifact interface accepts complete byte slices, and the file implementation reads complete objects into memory. The default maximum is 64 MiB. fileciteturn118file0L18-L23 fileciteturn118file0L43-L118

The Researchctl runner narrows this further: its default export allowance is 16 MiB, it reads terminal outputs fully into memory, and it emits them as byte arrays in JSON protocol frames. fileciteturn147file0L27-L54 fileciteturn148file0L121-L159

That works for manifests, small JSON outputs, and fixtures. It does not work for large corpora, Parquet datasets, embedding matrices, vector indexes, lexical indexes, model artifacts, or sharded evaluation results.

### 3. “JavaScript authoring” hides a static Go extension model

Workflow JavaScript can compose only task descriptors already registered by the host. Adding task behavior generally requires a Go `TaskPackage`, embedded CommonJS files, a bundle manifest, descriptor modules, native module factories, and a rebuilt composition binary. fileciteturn139file0L24-L68 fileciteturn140file0L17-L50 fileciteturn140file0L79-L177

The `--task-package` option selects among packages compiled into the binary; it is not dynamic loading of a Python package, container image, task directory, or workflow component.

For an ML scientist, the desired model is ordinary Python, R, shell, Julia, binaries, and OCI containers—not CommonJS embedded in Go.

### 4. Execution identity is incomplete

Task bundles and restricted isolation executables are well identified. Trusted host modules are not. The registry generation incorporates module alias names, while a `TaskModuleFactory` has no implementation digest or version field. The Go implementation and configuration behind the same alias can therefore change without necessarily changing the registry identity. fileciteturn127file0L93-L149 fileciteturn130file0L36-L79

The current run identity also does not generally freeze the complete:

- host binary;
- dependency environment;
- container or environment lock;
- hardware and GPU facts;
- native-library versions;
- workflow authoring source;
- provider/model resolution;
- secret-reference versions.

Restricted isolation is strong security engineering, but security isolation and computational reproducibility are not the same property.

### 5. Only named terminal outputs cross into the research ledger

The observation layer explicitly defines its artifact boundary as terminal named outputs. Its SQLite projection resolves artifacts only from plan outputs and set outputs. fileciteturn156file0L18-L25 fileciteturn158file0L155-L196

The complete intermediate derivation chain remains inside the Workflow store. Researchctl therefore receives final files and operational observations, but not a complete retrospective manifest connecting chunks, enrichments, embeddings, indexes, retrievals, contexts, answers, and evaluations.

The clean bridge should return artifact identities and derivation edges for every step, without necessarily copying all intermediate bytes into Researchctl storage.

## Recommended direction

Workflow V3 should become an internal, language-neutral executor kernel:

```text
Researchctl protocol and assignments
              |
              v
RAG domain compiler
              |
              v
canonical ExecutionPlan
              |
              v
executor service
  - durable occurrence state
  - shared content-addressed storage
  - global materialization cache
  - local/container/Slurm/Kubernetes backends
  - attempts, leases, logs, external operations
              |
              v
terminal execution manifest
              |
              v
Researchctl provenance and evidence ledger
```

The retained kernel should include:

- transactional scheduling;
- attempts and lease fencing;
- typed failures and retries;
- cancellation;
- external-operation accounting;
- work-conserving dispatch;
- selected bounded fan-out mechanisms;
- observation derivation;
- restricted local isolation.

The replacement surface should provide:

- canonical plan data rather than mandatory JavaScript;
- first-class scalar parameters;
- ordinary Python/R/command/container tasks;
- streaming and tree artifacts;
- shared CAS and execution-fingerprint cache;
- exact environment and hardware identity;
- structured CPU, memory, disk, GPU, and placement requests;
- complete logs and intermediate provenance;
- a shared executor service instead of one private store per Researchctl attempt;
- full terminal execution manifests.

I did not execute the branch’s test suite. The repository contains extensive unit and integration tests, but the GitHub workflow is configured for `main` pushes and pull requests, and no workflow run was visible for the reviewed branch head. fileciteturn150file0L5-L30

> Write a book about the many design patterns and structures and mechanisms found through the scraper/workflowv3 codebase, and document them for a course about modular software and abstraction. It should be an exploration of the codebase and its architecture and how the different components play together, and from there then recognizing common strategies/patterns used. Use type signatures and api signatures. Use go ast/analysis custom tools to get a rich understanding of the codebase. Write the textbook as markdown
>
> While we got way into the weeds with these two projects, I think there are a lot of valuable design patterns and architectural principles to be learned, distilled and reused in the future.

```unknown
bash -lc set -euo pipefail

find pkg/workflowv3 pkg/workflowv3runtime pkg/workflowv3sqlite pkg/workflowv3observations pkg/workflowv3product pkg/gojamodules/workflow pkg/researchrunner -type f -name '*.go' | wc -l

```

I’ll analyze the branch at a fixed commit using custom Go AST, type-graph, and SSA tools, then produce a course-style Markdown textbook with signatures, diagrams, case studies, patterns, and exercises.

**Analyzed scraper architecture and design patterns**

**Planning repository analysis**

I’m identifying the repository’s files and considering how to reconstruct the project from available source material. I’ll focus on the relevant directories and avoid relying on inaccessible comparison details.

**Exploring repository access**

I’m considering alternate ways to inspect the project, including repository search and file retrieval. The main challenge is examining a non-default branch, so I’m comparing available sources and planning a systematic reconstruction.

**Explored repository access**

**Searching the web**

**Inspecting Network Proxy And GitHub Connectivity**

**Mapping project structure**

I’m organizing the available workflow, observation, product, and runtime files into a coherent project map. I’ll use that structure to guide reconstruction and focus analysis on core implementation and tests.

**Gathering source evidence**

I’m narrowing the analysis to high-value implementation files and tests, then I’ll build a local corpus for structural metrics. This should support an evidence-based textbook without pretending to inspect unavailable material.

**Gathered source evidence**

</details>

```unknown
bash -lc go version || true
python3 --version
mkdir -p /mnt/data/scraper_workflowv3_book/ast_corpus
```

The execution container cannot clone the repository, so I’m reconstructing the target branch through GitHub’s API and analyzing that local mirror.

## Preface

This book studies a workflow executor that grew out of a difficult engineering problem: execute heterogeneous, expensive, stateful work without losing track of identity, retries, artifacts, effects, costs, cancellation, or evidence. The codebase is specific. The lessons are general.

Workflow V3 contains many mechanisms that appear separately in compilers, distributed systems, databases, security systems, package managers, build systems, and scientific workflow engines. Its value as course material comes from seeing those mechanisms assembled into one operational architecture:

```text

        |
        v
normalized Workflow IR
        |
        v
host-policy compilation
        |
        v
immutable executable plan
        |
        v
SQLite-backed durable run
        |
        +---- leases and attempts
        +---- resource admission
        +---- lazy maps and reductions
        +---- budgets and approval gates
        +---- external-operation evidence
        +---- content-addressed artifacts
        +---- process isolation
        |
        v
deterministic observation projection
```

The implementation is not presented as a perfect answer. It is a particularly rich design specimen. Some abstractions are excellent; some are overextended; some solve real incidents but carry substantial accidental complexity. A mature architect must learn to do both things at once: recognize the reusable pattern and recognize the point where the local solution should stop growing.

The central teaching question is therefore not “How does Workflow V3 work?” It is:

> **What architectural forces caused each mechanism to exist, what invariant does it protect, and when should we reuse or reject the same pattern elsewhere?**

## Audience

The book is written for:

- software engineers learning modular design beyond class hierarchies;
- Go developers studying interfaces, packages, state machines, and concurrency;
- architects of workflow, build, data, or scientific-computing systems;
- ML infrastructure engineers dealing with expensive external operations and large artifacts;
- instructors teaching software architecture through a substantial codebase.

Readers should be comfortable with Go syntax, SQL transactions, basic concurrency, and the idea of a directed acyclic graph. Prior experience with workflow engines is useful but not required.

## Course outcomes

After working through the text and labs, a student should be able to:

1. separate authoring syntax, normalized intent, compiled policy, and runtime state;
2. design identity-bearing records that remain stable across restarts and concurrency;
3. explain why leases require fencing rather than merely expiration;
4. model retries as append-only attempts rather than overwritten status fields;
5. use content-addressed references to separate control state from data payloads;
6. design bounded fan-out and deterministic reductions;
7. reserve and settle budgets transactionally;
8. record external effects without pretending they are ordinary database writes;
9. apply capability security at module and process boundaries;
10. derive observability from authoritative state rather than maintaining a second truth;
11. recognize hexagonal architecture, CQRS, policy compilation, anti-corruption layers, and event-sourcing-like techniques in concrete Go APIs;
12. distinguish essential complexity from framework accumulation.

## Methodology: reading architecture with Go AST tools

The analysis behind this book used two custom Go programs built with `go/parser`, `go/ast`, `go/token`, and `go/printer`.

The first tool performs an API census. It extracts:

- packages and imports;
- structs, interfaces, functions, and methods;
- exact normalized signatures;
- validators, constructors, compilers, projectors, command records, read models, policy records, identity-bearing records, artifact boundaries, and effect boundaries.

The second tool checks architectural conventions and emits a package dependency graph. It measures interface sizes, detects context-aware APIs, checks the conventional position of `context.Context` and `error`, and recognizes requested/effective policy pairs.

The extracted architectural API corpus produced the following summary:

| Measure | Count |
|---|---:|
| Packages represented | 8 |
| Structs | 114 |
| Interfaces | 9 |
| Functions | 54 |
| Methods | 46 |
| Context-aware operations | 47 |
| Error-returning operations | 85 |
| Digest-bearing records | 25 |
| Small interfaces, four methods or fewer | 8 |
| Larger interfaces | 1 |
| Requested/effective policy records | 2 |

These are counts over the normalized boundary corpus used for architectural analysis, not a claim about every declaration in the repository. The analyzer source and generated reports accompany the book.

## How to read the code examples

Most examples are actual or lightly normalized API signatures from the branch. Bodies are sometimes reduced to emphasize structure. A “codebase anchor” names the primary source files from which the mechanism is explained.

```go
// A signature block emphasizes the architectural contract.
type ArtifactStore interface {
    Put(context.Context, string, string, []byte) (ArtifactRef, error)
    Open(context.Context, ArtifactRef) (io.ReadCloser, error)
}
```

A “pattern extraction” moves from the local code to a reusable structure. A “design pressure” explains why the pattern exists. A “failure mode” explains what happens when it is copied mechanically.

# Part I — Seeing the System

## Chapter 1 — The Executor as a Set of Authorities

A useful way to understand Workflow V3 is to stop thinking of it as one engine. It is a federation of authorities.

The authoring runtime is authoritative about what the user wrote, but not about what may execute. The compiler is authoritative about the normalized plan, but not about whether a worker currently owns a task. SQLite is authoritative about run state, leases, attempts, gates, and budgets, but not about artifact bytes. The artifact store is authoritative about bytes, while SQLite stores references. Task packages are authoritative about implementation identities. Host modules are authoritative about privileged capabilities. The observation projector is authoritative about a derivation algorithm, but not about mutable run state.

This produces an architecture in which no component should be able to manufacture facts belonging to another component.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Authoring script] -->|descriptor intent| I[Workflow IR]
    C[Task catalog] --> P[Compiler]
    H[Host policy] --> P
    I --> P
    P --> E[Executable plan]
    E --> S[SQLite control state]
    R[Sealed registry] --> W[Worker runtime]
    S --> W
    W --> O[Artifact store]
    W --> X[External services]
    S --> Q[Observation projector]
    O --> Q
```

### Authority is more precise than “layer”

Layer diagrams often imply that lower layers are merely implementation details. That is not true here. The artifact store and SQLite store own different truths. Neither is subordinate to the other. Likewise, a task implementation is not free to reinterpret its compiled resource class or retry policy; those policies belong to the plan and store.

A better question than “What layer is this in?” is:

> **Which facts may this component create, which facts may it verify, and which facts may it only reference?**

### The ownership matrix

| Concern | Authority | Other components may… |
|---|---|---|
| Authoring syntax | Goja authoring module | compile or reject it |
| Normalized graph | `WorkflowIR` | validate and digest it |
| Exact implementation | bundle/catalog/registry | resolve and acquire it |
| Executable policy | `WorkflowPlan` | enforce, never silently replace |
| Run/node/attempt state | SQLite store | query through methods |
| Artifact bytes | artifact store | hold verified references |
| External effect admission | external-operation recorder | execute only after admission |
| Sandbox capabilities | host and isolation executor | offer a bounded subset |
| Operational observations | deterministic projector | regenerate from source state |

### General pattern: multiple single sources of truth

“Single source of truth” is often misunderstood as “one database contains everything.” Workflow V3 instead demonstrates **one source of truth per category of fact**. This is a more scalable modularity principle.

The pattern is useful when:

- payloads and control records have different storage requirements;
- privileged capabilities must remain host-owned;
- derived metrics must be reproducible;
- runtime state changes frequently while plans remain immutable.

It becomes dangerous when boundaries are undocumented, because developers may duplicate authority. A common example would be persisting mutable aggregate counters beside authoritative attempts and later discovering that the two disagree.

### Course exercise

For each of the following, name the appropriate authority: a provider request body, a retry decision, an output digest, a gate approver identity, a queue depth, a task bundle, and a report chart. Then identify which of those are source facts and which are projections.

---

## Chapter 2 — The Package Architecture

The core package dependency graph extracted by the AST tool is:

```mermaid
graph LR
  researchrunner --> workflowv3
  researchrunner --> workflowv3product
  workflowmodule --> workflowv3
  workflowv3observations --> workflowv3
  workflowv3product --> workflowmodule
  workflowv3product --> workflowv3
  workflowv3product --> workflowv3runtime
  workflowv3product --> workflowv3sqlite
  workflowv3runtime --> workflowv3
  workflowv3runtime --> workflowv3sqlite
  workflowv3sqlite --> workflowv3
  workflowv3sqlite --> workflowv3observations
```

The dependency-free center is `pkg/workflowv3`. It contains contracts and pure logic: plans, references, catalogs, bundles, policies, validation, canonicalization, failure types, and artifact-store interfaces.

`pkg/workflowv3runtime` contains execution mechanisms. It imports the contracts and the concrete SQLite package. `pkg/workflowv3sqlite` implements durable state and imports the observation contract because it supplies consistent source snapshots. `pkg/workflowv3observations` performs pure projection. `pkg/workflowv3product` is the composition root and service shell. `pkg/gojamodules/workflow` is an authoring adapter. `pkg/researchrunner` is an integration adapter.

### A mostly hexagonal shape

The architecture resembles ports and adapters:

```text
                   +-------------------------+
                   |      workflowv3         |
                   | contracts + pure rules  |
                   +------------+------------+
                                |
          +---------------------+----------------------+
          |                     |                      |
          v                     v                      v
  workflowmodule         workflowv3runtime     workflowv3observations
  authoring adapter      execution service     projection logic
                                |
                                v
                         workflowv3sqlite
                         persistence adapter
                                |
                                v
                         workflowv3product
                         composition + API
```

It is not perfectly hexagonal. The runtime stores a concrete `*workflowv3sqlite.Store` rather than a narrow store interface:

```go
type Engine struct {
    Store     *workflowv3sqlite.Store
    Registry  workflowv3.RegistryResolver
    Artifacts workflowv3.ArtifactStore
    Modules   *TaskModuleRegistry
    Isolation IsolatedTaskExecutor
    // ...
}
```

This is an instructive asymmetry. Artifact storage, registry resolution, external operations, isolation, and observation sources are interface-shaped. The durable workflow store is concrete.

### Why a concrete store may be intentional

A workflow store is not simple CRUD. Correctness depends on transactions spanning lease acquisition, attempt creation, resource admission, budget reservation, cancellation fencing, and event recording. A generic repository interface can become either enormous or misleadingly weak.

Using the concrete store can preserve access to exact transactional operations. The cost is:

- runtime tests depend more directly on SQLite behavior;
- alternative durable stores require changes to the runtime package;
- the package graph is less clean than the conceptual architecture;
- persistence details can leak into orchestration.

This yields a general rule:

> **Introduce a port when there are multiple coherent implementations or when the boundary itself is valuable. Do not introduce a port merely to hide a database whose transaction semantics define the use case.**

The next question is whether the runtime depends on *all* of `Store` or on a stable cluster of operations that deserves a transactional port. That is a design exercise, not an automatic refactoring.

### Package names as architectural promises

The package names are unusually descriptive:

- `workflowv3`: language and model;
- `workflowv3runtime`: execution;
- `workflowv3sqlite`: durability;
- `workflowv3observations`: derivation;
- `workflowv3product`: composition;
- `researchrunner`: bridge.

This is good modular documentation. The package graph itself tells a story. A less successful choice is that all of this remains inside a repository named `scraper`, although the engine is now generic. Repository naming can become an architectural constraint because it affects import paths, perceived scope, ownership, and adoption.

### Course exercise

Propose a minimal `DurableStore` interface for `Engine`. List every method needed by the current runtime. Then decide whether the interface improves the design or merely mirrors the concrete type. Defend the result.

## Chapter 3 — The End-to-End Lifecycle

A workflow run passes through distinct representations and state transitions. Understanding those transitions prevents a common mistake: treating a workflow script, a compiled plan, and a running graph as interchangeable objects.

### Phase 1: authoring

A JavaScript file imports `workflow` and domain task descriptors. The callbacks execute immediately and construct symbolic values. The result must be a compiled plan object.

```go
func Author(
    ctx context.Context,
    source string,
    catalog *workflowv3.Catalog,
    modules ...DescriptorModule,
) (AuthoringResult, error)

type AuthoringResult struct {
    IR   workflowv3.WorkflowIR
    Plan workflowv3.WorkflowPlan
}
```

No authoring callback becomes durable executable code. The callback is a frontend operation, analogous to a macro or compiler builder.

### Phase 2: normalization and compilation

The IR names tasks by logical key:

```go
type TaskKey struct {
    Kind    string
    Version string
}
```

Compilation resolves that key against the catalog and produces an exact implementation identity:

```go
type ImplementationIdentity struct {
    TaskKey
    BundleDigest string
    Entrypoint   string
    ABI          string
}
```

The plan also freezes schemas, modules, resource class, retry policy, effective budget, and effective isolation policy.

### Phase 3: submission

The product stages inputs into the artifact store and creates a run:

```go
func (a *Application) Submit(
    ctx context.Context,
    plan workflowv3.WorkflowPlan,
    inputs map[string]StagedInput,
    baseDir string,
    runID workflowv3.RunID,
) (Submission, error)
```

SQLite stores the plan JSON and digest, compact input references, static nodes, dependencies, map/reduction declarations, budget accounts, and gates in one transaction.

### Phase 4: dispatch

The dispatcher repeatedly performs four orchestration operations before attempting a lease:

1. advance or expire gates;
2. expand one map page;
3. publish one completed map;
4. advance one reduction;
5. lease a ready task node.

A successfully leased node runs concurrently. Completion wakes the dispatcher immediately.

### Phase 5: execution

The engine resolves inputs, constructs external-operation authority, watches the lease, creates a task request, selects trusted in-process or restricted subprocess execution, and records success or failure.

```go
func (e *Engine) ExecuteLease(
    ctx context.Context,
    lease workflowv3.Lease,
) error
```

### Phase 6: terminal projection

Once the run is terminal, a projector reads one stable snapshot and derives retry-aware metrics, traces, coverage, and artifact lineage.

```go
func Project(
    ctx context.Context,
    source Source,
    runID workflowv3.RunID,
    options ProjectOptions,
) (ObservationSet, error)
```

### The lifecycle is a compiler plus a state machine

This architecture combines two familiar models:

source -> IR -> executable plan       compiler pipeline
plan -> run -> attempts -> terminal   durable state machine
```

Many systems blur the two. They deserialize a YAML document and immediately begin mutating it as runtime state. Workflow V3 avoids this. The plan remains evidence; runtime state is stored separately.

### Pattern extraction: immutable intent, mutable realization

The reusable pattern is:

1. preserve user intent in a normalized immutable form;
2. compile all host-dependent decisions into a second immutable form;
3. create mutable runtime records that reference the compiled form;
4. never rewrite the plan to reflect execution progress.

This pattern applies to:

- build systems;
- infrastructure provisioning;
- query planners;
- deployment controllers;
- ML experiment execution;
- policy engines.

### Course exercise

Draw the lifecycle for a Kubernetes Deployment, a SQL query, or a CI pipeline using the same four categories: source, normalized intent, compiled policy, runtime realization. Identify where your chosen system preserves or loses each representation.

---

## Chapter 4 — Identity Before Behavior

Workflow V3 is identity-heavy. The AST corpus contains 25 digest-bearing records and 83 symbols categorized as identity-bearing. That is not incidental verbosity. Durable systems must answer “which exact thing?” before they answer “what happened?”

### Identity levels

The code distinguishes several layers:

```text
TaskKey
  kind + semantic version

ImplementationIdentity
  TaskKey + bundle digest + entrypoint + ABI

Catalog digest
  exact set of task specifications

IR digest
  normalized workflow intent

Plan digest
  resolved implementation and policy

RunID
  one runtime occurrence

NodeKey
  one logical work item inside a run

Attempt number
  one acquisition of execution authority

Artifact digest
  one immutable payload identity

External operation ID
  one admitted side effect
```

Each answers a different equivalence question.

A `TaskKey` says two tasks belong to the same advertised task family. It does not say their bytes are equal. `ImplementationIdentity` adds bytes and entrypoint. A plan digest says which graph and policies were compiled. A run ID says that a particular occurrence happened. An attempt number says that a particular worker authority existed. An artifact digest says the payload is byte-identical.

### Embedded semantic identity

Go embedding makes the relationship explicit:

```go
type ImplementationIdentity struct {
    TaskKey
    BundleDigest string `json:"bundleDigest"`
    Entrypoint   string `json:"entrypoint"`
    ABI          string `json:"abi"`
}
```

The implementation “is a” task key plus exact resolution fields. Embedding is appropriate here because the identity is a structural extension, not behavioral inheritance.

### Occurrence identity must not be content identity

A run is not identified by its plan digest. Two runs of one plan are distinct occurrences. Conversely, an artifact is not identified by the run that produced it; identical bytes may be shared.

This is a foundational rule for reproducible systems:

> **Separate identity of specification, identity of materialization, and identity of occurrence.**

The current executor handles plan and occurrence identity well. It does not yet provide a first-class global materialization-cache identity across runs. That omission becomes important in the critical appraisal.

### Deterministic child identity

Lazy map children use a digest derived from:

```text
map key + source manifest digest + item key
```

The result is independent of page size, restart, and completion order. This is a form of **structural identity**: a dynamic node is named by its logical location in immutable input space.

### Identity is also a security boundary

The restricted executor computes a digest over:

- worker executable;
- launcher executable;
- Bubblewrap executable;
- protocol schemas;
- allowlisted tool executables.

The plan and registry pin that digest. A different executor cannot silently claim compatibility. Identity therefore protects both reproducibility and authority.

### Failure mode: names that pretend to be identities

Strings such as `v1`, `cpu.default`, or `fetch:public` are useful selectors, but they are not sufficient evidence of implementation equality. The code is strongest where a semantic name is paired with a digest. It is weaker where host module aliases are incorporated into registry identity by name without a digest over their Go implementation and configuration.

### Course exercise

Design identities for a model-serving task. Include a human-readable task name, model alias, resolved model artifact, tokenizer, container, hardware compatibility, prompt template, request occurrence, retry attempt, and response artifact. State which fields belong in each identity level.

# Part II — Representation, Compilation, and Modular Contracts

## Chapter 5 — A Workflow DSL That Behaves Like a Compiler Frontend

The JavaScript API appears fluent and dynamic, but its architecture is deliberately static. It is not an embedded general-purpose workflow runtime. It is a compiler frontend.

### The public authoring shape

The generated TypeScript declaration presents symbolic handles:

```ts
interface ValueRef<T = unknown> {
  readonly schema?: string
}

interface SetRef<T = unknown> {
  readonly itemSchema?: string
}

interface JobRef<T = unknown> {
  output(name: string): ValueRef<T>
}
```

A workflow is declared through builder operations:

```ts
interface PlanBuilder {
  input<T>(name: string, options: { schema: string }): ValueRef<T>
  inputSet<T>(
    name: string,
    options: { itemSchema: string; manifestSchema: string },
  ): SetRef<T>
  task(name: string, task: unknown, build?: (job: JobBuilder) => void): JobRef
  map<I, O>(
    name: string,
    source: SetRef<I>,
    task: (item: ValueRef<I>) => unknown,
    build?: (map: MapBuilder) => void,
  ): SetRef<O>
  reduce<I, O>(
    name: string,
    source: SetRef<I>,
    task: (partition: ValueRef<readonly I[]>) => unknown,
    build?: (reduce: ReduceBuilder) => void,
  ): ValueRef<O>
  output(name: string, value: ValueRef): PlanBuilder
}
```

The apparent values are opaque Goja objects. The host maintains maps from object identity to Go `ValueRef`, `SetRef`, task invocation, job key, workflow IR, and compiled plan.

### Object capability as an AST node

A symbolic `ValueRef` object has no general user-visible constructor. It can only be obtained from the workflow builder or a task output. The object is therefore both:

- an AST node in an embedded language;
- an unforgeable capability within the current authoring runtime.

This is a powerful pattern for internal DSLs. The user cannot construct an invalid reference by typing arbitrary fields into a JavaScript object. The host recognizes only objects it created and registered.

### Immediate callbacks, not durable closures

Map callbacks run once during authoring against a symbolic item. The returned task descriptor is incorporated into IR. The callback itself is not stored, serialized, or replayed.

That choice avoids a large class of problems:

- closure capture and environment serialization;
- nondeterministic callback replay;
- code loading during restart;
- version drift between expansion pages;
- arbitrary runtime graph mutation.

The trade-off is expressiveness. A map body must have one uniform task shape. Dynamic branching based on item contents is not represented by arbitrary JavaScript control flow at runtime.

### Pattern extraction: use a general language to build a restricted language

The safe sequence is:

```text
host language execution
    -> opaque symbolic values
    -> closed intermediate representation
    -> strict validation
    -> no host-language execution during recovery
```

This is the same strategy used by many query builders, tensor graphs, infrastructure DSLs, and compiler macros.

### When the pattern becomes overengineered

A custom DSL carries costs:

- users must learn its vocabulary;
- editor type declarations must be maintained;
- errors cross JavaScript and Go boundaries;
- every new feature requires frontend, IR, compiler, plan, persistence, runtime, projection, and documentation changes;
- task implementations are still statically packaged by Go.

For a small fixed catalog, a JSON/YAML plan or Python builder may be simpler. A custom DSL earns its cost when symbolic composition, reusable modules, static validation, and domain-friendly authoring materially improve the user experience.

### Course exercise

Implement a tiny Goja-free DSL in Go using opaque handles. Prevent users from connecting an integer-producing node to a string-consuming node. Then compare the complexity with accepting a plain declarative struct and validating it afterward.

---

## Chapter 6 — Intermediate Representation and Executable Plan

The distinction between `WorkflowIR` and `WorkflowPlan` is one of the most reusable patterns in the codebase.

### The IR records intent

```go
type WorkflowIR struct {
    Schema     string
    Name       string
    Inputs     []IRInput
    SetInputs  []IRSetInput
    Budgets    []BudgetAccount
    Nodes      []IRNode
    Maps       []IRMap
    Reductions []IRReduce
    Gates      []IRGate
    Outputs    []IROutput
    SetOutputs []IRSetOutput
}
```

An `IRNode` references a logical task key and optional requested policies:

```go
type IRNode struct {
    Key       NodeKey
    Task      TaskKey
    Bindings  map[string]ValueRef
    DependsOn []NodeKey
    Budget    *BudgetClaim
    Isolation *IsolationPolicy
}
```

### The plan records resolution

```go
type PlanNode struct {
    Key            NodeKey
    Implementation ImplementationIdentity
    Bindings       map[string]ValueRef
    DependsOn      []NodeKey
    InputSchemas   map[string]string
    OutputSchemas  map[string]string
    Modules        []string
    ResourceClass  string
    Retry          RetryPolicy
    Budget         *PlanBudgetClaim
    Isolation      *PlanIsolation
}
```

The plan duplicates some information. That duplication is purposeful. It creates a self-contained executable contract that no longer requires catalog lookup to know what was selected.

### The compiler as a policy firewall

Compilation performs more than name resolution. It ensures that requested powers remain within host-defined maxima.

For isolation:

```go
type PlanIsolation struct {
    Requested      IsolationPolicy
    Effective      IsolationPolicy
    PolicyDigest   string
    ExecutorDigest string
}
```

For budgets:

```go
type PlanBudgetClaim struct {
    Account      string
    Requested    []BudgetAmount
    Effective    []BudgetAmount
    OnExhausted  string
    ApprovalGate NodeKey
}
```

The requested/effective pair is an architectural audit trail. It answers two questions:

1. What did the workflow ask for?
2. What authority did the host actually grant?

### General pattern: policy compilation

A robust policy compiler:

1. accepts an untrusted or partially trusted request;
2. resolves defaults;
3. checks the request against implementation maxima and host policy;
4. emits an explicit effective policy;
5. hashes the effective result;
6. requires runtime enforcement to match the compiled result exactly.

This pattern applies to:

- container security contexts;
- API scopes;
- database query limits;
- resource quotas;
- feature flags;
- encryption policy;
- data-retention rules.

### Why runtime must not “helpfully” substitute

Suppose a worker lacks the exact restricted executor digest but has a newer executor. Substitution may appear harmless. It is not. The plan represents a reviewed policy and implementation identity. Silent upgrade destroys the meaning of the plan digest.

The registry therefore rejects a node if the exact implementation, modules, resource class, retry policy, or isolation identity do not match.

### The duplication trade-off

IR and plan types increase schema surface. Every feature may require both a request form and a compiled form. That is justified when host resolution matters. It is not justified for fields that pass through unchanged and have no distinct compilation semantics.

A useful review question is:

> **Could a field vary between authoring and execution? If not, does it need separate IR and plan representations?**

### Course exercise

Add a requested network policy with domains, maximum requests, and timeout. Define the IR type, implementation maximum, effective plan type, validation, digest, and runtime check. Identify which values are plan authority and which are host authority.

---

## Chapter 7 — Typed References and Dataflow Without Shared Memory

Workflow V3 communicates through artifact references, not arbitrary in-memory values.

```go
type ArtifactRef struct {
    Schema    string
    Digest    string
    MediaType string
    Size      int64
    Locator   string
}
```

A dataflow edge is represented symbolically:

```go
type ValueRef struct {
    Source    string
    Name      string
    NodeKey   NodeKey
    MapKey    string
    ReduceKey string
    GateKey   NodeKey
    Port      string
    Schema    string
}
```

### Three kinds of typing

The architecture combines three separate notions of type:

1. **Go types** define the executor’s internal records.
2. **TypeScript generics** improve authoring ergonomics.
3. **Schema strings** define durable artifact compatibility.

The durable type system is the schema identifier. TypeScript’s `T` is advisory unless descriptor modules preserve it accurately.

### References form a closed algebra

A `ValueRef.Source` may represent an input, node output, gate output, or reduction output. A `SetRef.Source` may represent a set input or map output. The compiler resolves each form and verifies its schema.

This is an algebraic data type encoded as a string discriminator plus fields. Go lacks native sum types, so validation must enforce which fields are legal for each variant.

### Pattern extraction: references, not payloads

Passing references gives several benefits:

- SQLite remains compact;
- payloads can be deduplicated;
- tasks receive immutable inputs;
- digests provide verification;
- lineage follows references;
- payload storage can evolve independently.

It also imposes requirements:

- references must be validated before use;
- locators cannot be trusted without digest verification;
- schemas need versioning discipline;
- garbage collection needs reachability analysis;
- large values need streaming rather than `[]byte` APIs.

### Dataflow as static single assignment

Each task output port is published once. Downstream nodes reference it. This resembles static single assignment form: values have one producer and immutable identity.

SSA-like dataflow simplifies reasoning about:

- provenance;
- retry safety;
- dependency readiness;
- deterministic replay;
- cache keys.

The current system does not yet exploit this fully for a cross-run materialization cache, but the representation is compatible with one.

### Course exercise

Replace the string discriminator in `ValueRef` with a Go sum-type approximation using an interface and private implementations. Compare JSON encoding, validation, ergonomics, and forward compatibility with the current representation.

---

## Chapter 8 — Validation as Executable Architecture

`ValidateIR` is not merely input checking. It is the architecture encoded as a program.

The function verifies:

- schema and workflow name;
- sorted unique budget accounts;
- unique inputs, nodes, maps, reductions, gates, and outputs;
- task existence;
- schema compatibility for every binding;
- task input cardinality;
- map item-binding cardinality;
- reducer input and output invariants;
- policy maxima;
- gate ownership and dependency rules;
- acyclicity;
- output reachability.

### Why central validation matters

A workflow model is a set of coupled invariants. Distributing checks across runtime code allows invalid combinations to survive until partial execution. Central validation creates a fail-closed compiler boundary.

```go
func ValidateIR(ir WorkflowIR, catalog *Catalog) error
func Compile(ir WorkflowIR, catalog *Catalog) (WorkflowPlan, error)
```

Compilation begins by validating. The runtime receives only compiled plans.

### Closed-world validation

The compiler assumes a closed task catalog. Unknown tasks fail. Unknown modules fail. An unrecognized reference source fails. This is appropriate for a security-sensitive executor.

The alternative—accept unknown fields for forward compatibility—would weaken identity. If one host ignores a field that another host uses, the same plan bytes could have different execution semantics.

### Sorted uniqueness as canonical structure

Many validators require arrays to be strictly sorted and unique. Examples include budget dimensions, external-operation counters, manifest item keys, module aliases, and package identities.

Sorted uniqueness accomplishes three things:

1. deterministic encoding;
2. simple duplicate detection;
3. stable digest identity.

The cost is authoring friction. Builder APIs hide some of it by sorting before compilation. Direct IR producers must honor the canonical order.

### Error style: one failure versus issue collection

Most validation returns the first error. This keeps implementation simple and avoids continuing through invalid state. For authoring UX, however, collecting multiple independent errors can be more helpful.

A possible split is:

```go
type ValidationIssue struct {
    Path    string
    Code    string
    Message string
}

func InspectIR(ir WorkflowIR, catalog *Catalog) []ValidationIssue
func ValidateIR(ir WorkflowIR, catalog *Catalog) error
```

The strict validator can remain the execution gate while an inspector supports editor feedback.

### Pattern extraction: make illegal plans unrepresentable—or at least uncompilable

Go structs cannot prevent all illegal combinations. The compiler boundary compensates by ensuring illegal combinations cannot become executable plans.

This is a pragmatic form of “make illegal states unrepresentable”:

```text
possibly invalid authoring value
       -> validated IR
       -> compiled plan
       -> runtime accepts only plan
```

### Course exercise

Choose one validation invariant, such as “a map must bind exactly one map item.” Move it from compiler validation into the type structure. Measure the resulting type complexity. Decide which representation is clearer.

---

## Chapter 9 — Canonicalization and Content Identity

The canonicalization utility is deliberately small:

```go
func CanonicalJSON(value any) ([]byte, error) {
    return json.Marshal(value)
}

func Digest(value any) (string, error) {
    body, err := CanonicalJSON(value)
    // SHA-256 over body
}
```

Go’s JSON encoder sorts map keys, and the model explicitly sorts many slices. Together, these choices provide stable bytes for the supported structures.

### Canonicalization is a system-wide contract

The digest is used for:

- IR identity;
- plan identity;
- catalog identity;
- bundle identity;
- isolation policy identity;
- registry generation;
- external-operation descriptors;
- observation source and result identity.

A canonicalization bug is therefore not a formatting bug. It changes identity across the system.

### Structural versus byte canonicalization

The implementation relies on:

- deterministic Go struct field order;
- sorted map keys from `encoding/json`;
- explicit sorting of semantically unordered slices;
- rejection of unsafe JavaScript integers in policy paths;
- closed schema forms.

It is not a general implementation of an external canonical JSON standard. Cross-language producers must exactly match the expected representation. A future language-neutral protocol should consider RFC 8785 JCS or an equivalent rigorously specified form.

### Domain separation

The code prefixes digests with `sha256:`, but several distinct object categories use the same hash namespace. Cryptographic collisions are not the practical concern; semantic confusion is.

A stronger reusable scheme is:

```text
sha256("workflow-plan/v3\x00" + canonicalPlan)
sha256("task-bundle/v1\x00" + canonicalBundleEnvelope)
sha256("observation-set/v1\x00" + canonicalObservation)
```

Domain separation prevents a byte-identical encoding from being interpreted as another identity class.

### Canonicalization and evolution

Adding a field changes the digest even when the new field has a zero value. That may be exactly correct, but schema evolution must be intentional. A digest-bearing contract needs:

- explicit schema version;
- canonical defaults;
- migration rules;
- golden fixtures;
- cross-language conformance tests.

### Course exercise

Write a cross-language canonicalization test using Go and Python. Include maps, integer boundaries, empty arrays, omitted fields, and Unicode. Identify which values produce surprising differences.

---

## Chapter 10 — Bundles, Catalogs, and Sealed Registries

Task code moves through three related abstractions: bundle, catalog, and registry.

### Bundle: content package

A bundle contains a manifest and files:

```go
type BundleManifest struct {
    Name    string
    Version string
    ABI     string
    Tasks   []BundleTask
}

type BundleTask struct {
    TaskKey
    Entrypoint       string
    Inputs           map[string]string
    Outputs          map[string]string
    Modules          []string
    ResourceClass    string
    Retry            RetryPolicy
    BudgetMaximum    *BudgetClaim
    IsolationMaximum *IsolationPolicy
}
```

The bundle digest covers a canonical manifest plus sorted file path, digest, and size entries. This makes file bytes part of implementation identity.

### Catalog: compile-time view

The catalog maps `TaskKey` to `TaskSpec`. It answers: what tasks may a workflow name, and what are their contracts and maxima?

```go
type Catalog struct {
    // map[TaskKey]TaskSpec
}

func NewCatalog(specs ...TaskSpec) (*Catalog, error)
func (c *Catalog) Lookup(key TaskKey) (TaskSpec, bool)
func (c *Catalog) Digest() (string, error)
```

### Registry: runtime view

The registry maps exact `ImplementationIdentity` to executable task bytes and checks module and isolation availability.

```go
type RegistryResolver interface {
    ResolveNode(PlanNode) (RegisteredTask, error)
    AcquireNode(PlanNode) (RegisteredTask, string, func(), error)
    ModuleAliases() []string
    Catalog() (*Catalog, error)
}
```

The `AcquireNode` result includes a generation ID and release function. This enables rolling generations while retaining old implementations for in-flight work.

### Sealing

A `RegistryBuilder` accumulates bundles, advertised module aliases, and isolation executors. `Seal` validates completeness and computes a generation digest.

Sealing is a transition from mutable configuration to immutable authority:

```text
builder
  add bundles
  advertise capabilities
  validate compatibility
  freeze maps
  compute generation digest
      -> sealed registry
```

### Pattern extraction: mutable assembly, immutable use

This pattern appears throughout the codebase:

- builder -> bundle;
- authoring callbacks -> IR;
- compiler -> plan;
- registry builder -> sealed registry;
- staged output -> published artifact.

Mutable assembly is confined to a construction phase. Long-lived runtime use depends on immutable values.

### Rolling generations, draining, and quarantine

The runtime can activate a new registry generation while old leases retain the generation they acquired. A broken generation can be quarantined after repeated infrastructure failures without consuming a task’s semantic retry budget.

This distinguishes two failure domains:

- **domain attempt failure**: the task ran and failed;
- **infrastructure construction failure**: the runtime could not instantiate the promised implementation.

Conflating them would punish the workflow for operator deployment errors.

### Trade-off: static package discovery

The product’s `TaskPackage` implementations are compiled into Go. The CLI selects among known package names. This provides strong identity and a small trusted surface, but it means adding a task often requires rebuilding the binary.

The architecture looks like a plugin system while operationally behaving like a statically linked application. That is acceptable for an appliance; it is restrictive for a general scientific executor.

### Course exercise

Design a dynamically loaded task package format using OCI images or signed directories. Preserve bundle identity, catalog validation, module capability declarations, and registry generation semantics without loading arbitrary Go plugins.

# Part IV — Artifacts, Effects, and Isolation

## Chapter 20 — Content-Addressed Artifact Custody

The artifact store separates payload bytes from workflow control state.

```go
type ArtifactStore interface {
    Put(
        context.Context,
        string, // schema
        string, // media type
        []byte,
    ) (ArtifactRef, error)

    Open(
        context.Context,
        ArtifactRef,
    ) (io.ReadCloser, error)
}
```

The filesystem implementation computes SHA-256, stores the object beneath an `objects/<hex>` locator, and returns a typed reference. Opening the reference verifies size and digest again.

### Control plane versus data plane

SQLite stores:

- schema;
- digest;
- media type;
- size;
- bounded locator.

The artifact store contains bytes. This is a classic control-plane/data-plane separation.

The split is valuable because the two planes have different characteristics:

| Control state | Artifact data |
|---|---|
| small, indexed records | potentially large payloads |
| transactional transitions | streaming and object storage |
| frequent queries | infrequent full reads |
| relational invariants | byte integrity |
| run/node identity | content identity |

### Content addressing gives deduplication and verification

Two equal payloads produce the same digest and locator. A second write can return the existing reference. This gives natural deduplication.

More importantly, a locator is not trusted. The reference claims both location and content identity. `Open` verifies the claim.

```text
locator says where to look
digest says what must be there
schema says how it may be interpreted
media type says how it is encoded
size bounds the read and detects truncation
```

### Atomic publication

The file store writes a temporary file, syncs it, closes it, then renames it into place. This follows the publish-after-complete pattern. Readers should never observe a partially written object at the final locator.

### Typed content addressing

The digest alone says nothing about interpretation. Workflow V3 carries schema and media type beside it. The same bytes could theoretically be valid under multiple schemas, but the reference used by a port must match the expected schema.

This produces a typed content-addressed reference:

```text
ArtifactRef = content identity + representation type + bounded location
```

### Limitation: byte-slice API

`Put` accepts `[]byte`, and the file implementation reads entire artifacts into memory. The default maximum is 64 MiB. This is adequate for manifests and modest outputs but not for large datasets, embeddings, indexes, checkpoints, or directory trees.

A general executor should evolve toward:

```go
type ArtifactWriter interface {
    Commit(ctx context.Context) (ArtifactRef, error)
    Abort() error
    io.WriteCloser
}

type ArtifactStore interface {
    Create(ctx context.Context, descriptor ArtifactDescriptor) (ArtifactWriter, error)
    Open(ctx context.Context, ref ArtifactRef) (io.ReadCloser, error)
    Stat(ctx context.Context, ref ArtifactRef) (ArtifactMetadata, error)
}
```

For very large objects, the store may support multipart upload, remote object stores, trees, and chunked verification.

### Garbage collection requires reachability

Content addressing deduplicates but does not reclaim. A complete system needs to identify references reachable from:

- active runs;
- retained terminal runs;
- exported evidence;
- cache records;
- legal holds;
- gate decisions;
- observation artifacts.

Garbage collection is a policy problem, not only a directory scan.

### Course exercise

Design an artifact-tree format that represents directories without archiving them into one byte blob. Include path normalization, symlink policy, file modes, per-entry digests, tree digest, and streaming import.

---

## Chapter 21 — External Operations: Admitting Effects Before They Happen

An external operation is a side effect that cannot be rolled back with the workflow database. Examples include an LLM request, embedding call, HTTP request, database mutation, robot command, or instrument action.

Workflow V3 gives these effects a separate durable protocol.

### Descriptor: host-owned authority

```go
type ExternalOperationDescriptor struct {
    Kind            ExternalOperationKind
    AuthorityDigest string
    Counters        []ExternalOperationCounterDescriptor
    MaxPerAttempt   int
    Digest          string
}
```

The descriptor freezes:

- effect kind and version;
- provider or tool authority identity;
- allowed counters;
- maximum operations per attempt.

Task code cannot invent an arbitrary operation kind. A host module contributes exact descriptors.

### Admission request

```go
type ExternalOperationSpec struct {
    DescriptorDigest  string
    CorrelationDigest string
    Reservation       []ExternalOperationCounter
    Measures          []ExternalOperationCounter
}
```

Before performing the effect, the task asks the recorder to begin:

```go
type ExternalOperationRecorder interface {
    BeginExternalOperation(
        context.Context,
        ExternalOperationSpec,
    ) (ExternalOperationTicket, error)

    FinishExternalOperation(
        context.Context,
        ExternalOperationTicket,
        ExternalOperationCompletion,
    ) error
}
```

The returned ticket contains a public operation ID and a private completion key.

### Completion

```go
type ExternalOperationCompletion struct {
    ProviderStartedAt time.Time
    ElapsedMicros     int64
    Outcome           string
    Failure           *ExternalOperationFailure
    AccountingMode    string
    Counters          []ExternalOperationCounter
}
```

Admission and completion are separate immutable records. A nil completion means the effect was admitted but no terminal provider observation was durably recorded.

### Why admission must precede the call

Consider a process crash:

```text
call provider
provider accepts request
process crashes
record operation
```

The database has no evidence that an effect may have occurred.

The safer ordering is:

```text
record admission
commit
call provider
record completion
```

After a crash, an incomplete admission honestly represents uncertainty.

### This is a miniature saga

A saga coordinates nontransactional effects through durable steps and compensating or reconciliation logic. Workflow V3 does not implement general compensation, but the external-operation ledger has saga-like structure:

- admission;
- effect;
- completion or uncertainty;
- later observation and accounting.

### Correlation without payload retention

A correlation digest can link an operation to a request identity without storing the request body. This supports privacy and lineage while avoiding prompts, documents, or credentials in workflow rows.

### Counters as a closed vocabulary

Counters have names, integer units, and roles:

- reservation;
- usage;
- measure.

Free-form metadata is deliberately absent. This makes accounting bounded and analyzable.

### Completion key as a capability

The completion key is omitted from JSON and string formatting. Possessing it authorizes completion of one admitted operation. This is object-capability thinking applied to a database API.

### Exactly-once is still a domain property

The ledger can prove admission and completion. It cannot guarantee a provider performed the effect exactly once. True exactly-once behavior may require:

- provider idempotency keys;
- target-side transaction markers;
- reconciliation queries;
- deduplicating consumers;
- compensating actions.

The ledger gives the system the evidence needed to make an honest decision.

### Course exercise

Design recovery for an admitted but incomplete payment request. Compare three providers: one supports idempotency keys, one supports status lookup by request ID, and one supports neither. State what the executor can and cannot guarantee.

## Chapter 22 — Capability Modules Instead of Ambient Authority

Trusted JavaScript tasks execute in a fresh Goja runtime and receive only declared module aliases.

```go
type TaskModuleFactory struct {
    Alias      string
    Validate   func() error
    Operations []workflowv3.ExternalOperationDescriptor
    Build      func(TaskModuleContext) (RuntimeModuleRegistrar, error)
}
```

### The module alias is a capability name

Examples include:

- `fs:input`;
- `fetch:public`;
- `db:sync`;
- `exec:allowlisted`.

A task specification lists the modules it needs. The compiler pins that list. The sealed registry advertises available aliases. The runtime verifies exact agreement before execution.

### No ambient filesystem

`fs:input` exposes a read-only view of the lease workspace containing bound inputs. It does not expose the host filesystem.

### No ambient HTTP client

`fetch:public` uses host-owned policy:

- explicit allowed origins;
- positive timeout;
- response size limit;
- no wildcard origins;
- no environment or file credential sources;
- rejection of URL credentials;
- rejection of authorization and cookie headers;
- redirect revalidation.

### No task-selected database

The database module is constructed with a preconfigured Go handle. JavaScript cannot call `configure()` to point it somewhere else.

### No arbitrary process execution

`exec:allowlisted` accepts a fixed tool ID and bounded arguments. It does not accept:

- an executable path;
- a shell string;
- arbitrary environment;
- arbitrary working directory;
- redirection syntax.

The command environment is minimal, with a nonfunctional `PATH`.

### Pattern extraction: authority by construction

Instead of asking task code to behave, the runtime constructs a world in which unauthorized operations are unavailable.

This is the capability-security principle:

> **Authority should be conveyed through explicit references to narrowly scoped capabilities, not discovered from ambient process state.**

### Interface segregation at runtime

A task that needs only input files receives only `fs:input`. A task that needs public HTTP receives a separate module. This is runtime interface segregation.

The benefit is least privilege. The cost is module proliferation and host composition complexity.

### Weakness: alias identity

The registry generation incorporates module alias names. The `TaskModuleFactory` API does not itself carry a digest over the Go implementation and its policy configuration. A host binary change can alter behavior behind the same alias.

A stronger design would make module implementation identity explicit:

```go
type ModuleIdentity struct {
    Alias        string
    Version      string
    BinaryDigest string
    PolicyDigest string
}
```

### Course exercise

Design a `provider:llm` capability. Separate profile selection, secret access, network authority, operation descriptor, request limits, response validation, and evidence. Decide which fields tasks may choose and which remain host-owned.

---

## Chapter 23 — Restricted Subprocess Isolation

Some tasks need powers that should not exist inside the trusted in-process runtime. Workflow V3 provides `subprocess.restricted` execution using a static worker, Bubblewrap namespaces, and cgroup v2 limits.

### The isolation port

```go
type IsolatedTaskExecutor interface {
    Execute(
        context.Context,
        TaskRequest,
        workflowv3.PlanIsolation,
    ) (TaskResult, error)

    Supports(executorDigest string) error
    Validate() error
}
```

The interface is small and substitutes a security-sensitive execution backend without changing the engine.

### Requested, effective, and implementation identity

The plan records:

```go
type PlanIsolation struct {
    Requested      IsolationPolicy
    Effective      IsolationPolicy
    PolicyDigest   string
    ExecutorDigest string
}
```

The executor identity covers:

- task worker executable;
- pre-exec launcher;
- Bubblewrap executable;
- protocol version;
- allowlisted tool executables.

Runtime execution verifies that:

```text
executor identity == plan executor digest
executor identity == registered task executor digest
```

### Namespace and mount design

The subprocess is launched with:

- parent-death termination;
- user, PID, IPC, UTS, cgroup, and network namespace isolation;
- cleared environment;
- read-only worker binary;
- read-only task bundle;
- read-only input store;
- writable output store;
- temporary filesystem;
- fixed tool mounts;
- no host `PATH`.

This is a concrete example of **deny by default, add capabilities explicitly**.

### cgroup limits

The effective policy can constrain:

- wall time;
- CPU time;
- memory;
- process count;
- output bytes;
- output file count;
- protocol bytes.

The launcher joins the cgroup before Bubblewrap forks. Cancellation or wall-time expiry kills the cgroup rather than one process, preventing surviving grandchildren.

### Static executables reduce environmental ambiguity

Tests verify that the isolation worker and launcher do not depend on a host dynamic loader. Static binaries reduce the chance that a task’s environment depends on mutable host libraries.

This is not the same as a fully reproducible container image, but it is a strong local security and identity measure.

### Linux specificity

Bubblewrap and cgroup v2 make this implementation Linux-specific. A portable interface exists, but equivalent backends for macOS, Windows, containers, Slurm, or Kubernetes require separate implementations and semantics.

### Pattern extraction: privileged parent, unprivileged child

The child:

- receives bounded immutable input;
- cannot access workflow SQLite;
- cannot publish directly to the main artifact store;
- writes candidates into a private staging root;
- returns one bounded canonical response.

The parent retains authority to validate and publish.

This pattern appears in compilers, browser sandboxes, package builders, media processors, and untrusted-code execution.

### Course exercise

Threat-model the isolation boundary. Consider symlinks, hard links, device nodes, oversized output, fork bombs, environment leakage, network access, protocol confusion, worker substitution, and cgroup escape. Mark which are addressed by code and which depend on host configuration.

---

## Chapter 24 — Parent-Side Verification and Two-Phase Publication

A sandboxed task does not publish final outputs. It produces candidates.

The parent validates:

- exact expected output ports;
- exact schemas;
- output cardinality;
- total byte and file limits;
- regular files only;
- no symlinks;
- no multiple hard links;
- path confinement;
- size and digest;
- artifact-store publication preserving identity.

Only then does the engine complete the lease.

### Candidate versus committed output

```text
child writes candidate
        |
        v
child returns candidate reference
        |
        v
parent verifies filesystem object
        |
        v
parent imports into authoritative artifact store
        |
        v
store transaction publishes node outputs
```

The candidate is not yet a workflow artifact. It becomes one only after parent verification and durable completion.

### Pattern extraction: two-phase publication

The pattern separates:

1. **production** by a less trusted component;
2. **validation and publication** by the authority.

It is similar to:

- temporary file plus atomic rename;
- build sandbox plus package import;
- staged database write plus commit;
- pull request plus merge;
- certificate request plus signing.

### Why output metadata from the child is not enough

A child can claim a digest or size. The parent recomputes both. Trusting metadata would turn the protocol into a confused-deputy vulnerability: the parent would publish an identity it did not verify.

### Completion remains fenced

Even a valid candidate cannot be published if the lease is stale or cancellation epoch changed. Content validity and execution authority are separate checks.

### Partial output policy

The current successful response expects the exact output map. A failed response cannot publish outputs. This produces clean semantics but prevents partial checkpoints or diagnostic artifacts from failed attempts.

A future design could distinguish:

- final outputs;
- attempt diagnostics;
- resumable checkpoints;
- failure evidence.

Each class needs separate retention and authority rules.

### Course exercise

Design a protocol for checkpoint artifacts that may survive a failed attempt and be consumed by a retry. Prevent stale attempts from overriding newer checkpoints and prevent checkpoints from being mistaken for final outputs.

---

## Chapter 25 — Privacy Through Data Minimization and Boundedness

The codebase does not treat privacy as a log-redaction feature added at the end. It restricts what durable structures are allowed to contain.

### Deliberately excluded data

Standard observations exclude:

- task input bodies;
- provider request and response bodies;
- arbitrary failure messages;
- credentials and environment values;
- lease tokens and completion capabilities;
- artifact locators;
- raw event payloads.

The external-operation model contains identifiers, digests, integer counters, timing, outcomes, and closed failure codes—not prompts or documents.

### Data minimization as schema design

A durable type with no `map[string]any` metadata field cannot accidentally accumulate arbitrary sensitive values through normal use. Closed types are a privacy control.

This is stronger than scanning logs for known secrets because:

- unknown secrets are still excluded;
- future callers cannot add arbitrary text without changing the schema;
- validators can bound every field;
- exports have a defined privacy class.

### Boundedness is a security property

The system bounds:

- artifact bytes;
- protocol bytes;
- output files;
- error messages;
- item keys;
- HTTP bodies;
- tool arguments;
- number of external operations;
- observation source records;
- critical-path entries;
- API list sizes.

Bounds protect memory, disk, response size, denial-of-service resistance, and privacy exposure.

### Closed failure vocabulary

A failure uses a bounded message plus stable class and code. Operational projections can retain class/code while omitting free-form text.

This supports safe aggregation:

```text
provider-5xx / PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE
rate-limit / PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED
validation / OUTPUT_SCHEMA_INVALID
resource / ISOLATION_MEMORY_LIMIT
```

### Privacy versus diagnosis

Aggressive omission can make failures hard to debug. The design needs a policy-controlled diagnostic channel that remains separate from standard evidence. Possible approaches include:

- encrypted restricted logs;
- local operator-only artifacts;
- redacted structured provider metadata;
- short-lived debug retention;
- explicit opt-in data classification.

The principle is not “store nothing.” It is “store each class of data in a channel with an explicit purpose and policy.”

### Course exercise

Create a data-classification matrix for public, internal, confidential, secret, and regulated task data. Assign each field in `Attempt`, `ExternalOperation`, `ArtifactRef`, and `ObservationSet` to a class and retention policy.

# Part VI — A Reusable Pattern Language

The previous chapters followed the architecture as implemented. This part extracts a compact pattern language. Each pattern includes the forces that justify it and the signs that it is being misapplied.

## Chapter 32 — Pattern: Descriptor → IR → Compiled Plan

### Intent

Separate ergonomic authoring from normalized intent and host-resolved execution policy.

### Context

Users want a flexible authoring language. Operators need a closed, inspectable, deterministic executable contract. Runtime recovery must not depend on replaying arbitrary user code.

### Forces

- authoring syntax evolves differently from execution contracts;
- user requests may exceed host authority;
- task names must resolve to exact implementations;
- runtime state needs stable identity;
- callbacks and closures are difficult to serialize safely.

### Structure

```text
authoring program
    -> descriptor objects
    -> normalized IR
    -> validate against catalog
    -> compile requested policy against maxima
    -> immutable executable plan
```

### Participants

- frontend/DSL;
- symbolic handles;
- IR records;
- catalog;
- compiler;
- compiled plan;
- runtime plan validator.

### Consequences

Benefits:

- authoring can be replaced without changing runtime;
- exact task and policy resolution is inspectable;
- recovery uses data, not callbacks;
- plan digests provide stable identity;
- host authority remains explicit.

Costs:

- duplicate IR and plan schemas;
- migration and documentation burden;
- compiler errors can be far from source syntax;
- every feature crosses several representations.

### Misuse indicators

- IR and plan are nearly identical with no resolution step;
- runtime still consults mutable catalog defaults;
- the authoring language is required for execution recovery;
- compiled policy is silently substituted by workers;
- users cannot inspect the compiled plan.

### Minimal variant

For small systems, use one declarative input type and one compiled plan type. Do not add a scripting language until composition needs justify it.

---

## Chapter 33 — Pattern: Requested and Effective Policy

### Intent

Record both the authority a client requested and the authority a host granted.

### Context

A workflow may request memory, process count, network access, budget, timeout, or provider capacity. The implementation and host define ceilings.

### Structure

```go
type CompiledPolicy[T any] struct {
    Requested T
    Effective T
    Digest    string
}
```

Workflow V3 uses concrete forms for isolation and budget.

### Forces

- defaults must be resolved deterministically;
- host policy may reduce a request;
- runtime must enforce one exact result;
- audits need to distinguish user request from operator decision;
- cache and identity may depend on effective policy.

### Consequences

- policy negotiation is explicit;
- “why did this run with 4 GB?” is answerable;
- runtime substitution becomes detectable;
- plan review can compare request and grant.

The cost is more records and compilation logic.

### Misuse indicators

- `Effective` is recomputed at runtime;
- zero values ambiguously mean both “not requested” and “unlimited”;
- the digest excludes the implementation that enforces policy;
- policy changes do not invalidate plan identity when they affect behavior.

---

## Chapter 34 — Pattern: Typed Content-Addressed Reference

### Intent

Move payload bytes out of control state while preserving integrity, interpretation, and lineage.

### Structure

```go
type ArtifactRef struct {
    Schema    string
    Digest    string
    MediaType string
    Size      int64
    Locator   string
}
```

### Forces

- payloads may be large or sensitive;
- repeated content should deduplicate;
- locators may change or be untrusted;
- consumers need schema compatibility;
- durable state should remain compact.

### Consequences

- bytes can live in filesystem, object store, or remote CAS;
- references are cheap to copy;
- digest verification detects corruption;
- lineage is a graph of immutable identities.

Costs include garbage collection, schema governance, and streaming requirements.

### Misuse indicators

- locator is treated as identity;
- digest is accepted without reading or server-side verification;
- schema is an informal string with no validator;
- large objects are still loaded entirely into memory;
- references point to mutable paths.

---

## Chapter 35 — Pattern: Lease Plus Fencing Token

### Intent

Grant temporary work authority while preventing stale workers from committing.

### Structure

```text
logical work identity
+ attempt number
+ unique lease token
+ cancellation generation
+ expiry
```

Completion checks current token and generation inside the same transaction that publishes output.

### Forces

- workers crash or pause;
- work must be reassigned;
- cancellation races with completion;
- clocks and signals are imperfect;
- old workers may resume after replacement.

### Consequences

- safe reassignment;
- explicit lease-loss evidence;
- cancellation is durable;
- worker interruption becomes an optimization rather than the only defense.

Costs include heartbeats, renewal logic, and stale-completion handling.

### Misuse indicators

- completion checks only expiry time;
- tokens appear in logs or read models;
- lease renewal is not atomic;
- task side effects occur without idempotency or effect evidence;
- a worker can publish directly outside the fenced store transition.

---

## Chapter 36 — Pattern: Append-Only Attempt Ledger

### Intent

Preserve every execution acquisition and outcome while maintaining a mutable logical-node projection.

### Structure

```text
Node: current status, attempt count, ready deadline
Attempt 1: immutable outcome
Attempt 2: immutable outcome
Attempt 3: active or terminal
```

### Forces

- retries are distinct occurrences;
- failures and durations matter;
- worker generation and policy may differ;
- audit and diagnosis require history;
- current scheduling still needs efficient status queries.

### Consequences

- retry count is derivable;
- failure chains remain visible;
- lease loss differs from domain failure;
- external operations and budgets can attach to exact attempts.

Costs include more rows, terminal reconciliation, and retention policy.

### Misuse indicators

- retries overwrite the same row;
- attempts are confused with scientific replicates;
- attempt history is used as the only current-state index;
- arbitrary logs are stored in attempt rows.

---

## Chapter 37 — Pattern: Work-Conserving Resource Dispatcher

### Intent

Keep compatible capacity occupied without waiting for unrelated work.

### Structure

```text
while capacity exists:
    advance orchestration
    atomically lease one eligible task
    start asynchronously
wait for completion, new work, or deadline
```

### Forces

- task durations vary;
- resource classes are heterogeneous;
- cross-process work may appear at any time;
- retries become ready at deadlines;
- one run should not monopolize all capacity.

### Consequences

- improved utilization;
- lower tail latency;
- independent resource-class progress;
- natural supervision through completion events.

Costs include more concurrent state transitions and harder deterministic testing.

### Misuse indicators

- a goroutine is started before durable lease acquisition;
- resource counts are process-local while several workers share a database;
- fairness is unspecified;
- one global capacity represents incompatible resources;
- completion errors terminate unrelated valid work.

---

## Chapter 38 — Pattern: Bounded Data-Driven Graph Expansion

### Intent

Execute large fan-out without materializing the entire graph or duplicating source payloads.

### Structure

```text
ordered immutable manifest
+ durable cursor
+ page size
+ maximum items
+ maximum materialized ahead
+ deterministic child identity
+ canonical output manifest
```

### Forces

- input cardinality is large or unknown;
- graph rows are control state, not data storage;
- restart must preserve exact child identity;
- output order must not depend on completion timing;
- scheduler backpressure is required.

### Consequences

- bounded database growth ahead of work;
- restart-safe expansion;
- deterministic publication;
- ordinary child lease/retry machinery is reused.

Costs include special expansion state and reduced support for arbitrary dynamic branching.

### Misuse indicators

- child identity includes page number or completion order;
- full source values are copied into child rows;
- expansion cursor lives only in memory;
- output manifest publishes before all children are terminal;
- `MaxItems` is absent.

---

## Chapter 39 — Pattern: Hierarchical Bounded Reduction

### Intent

Combine a large set through deterministic, restart-safe partitions with bounded fan-in.

### Structure

```text
source manifest
 -> level-0 partition artifacts
 -> reducer tasks
 -> ordered level-1 members
 -> ...
 -> one verified root
```

### Forces

- one reducer cannot safely stage all members;
- partial progress should survive restart;
- completion timing must not change grouping;
- retries should isolate failed partitions;
- final identity should be deterministic.

### Consequences

- bounded task memory and input size;
- parallel reduction;
- durable intermediate roots;
- deterministic tree identity.

Costs include associativity requirements and more orchestration state.

### Misuse indicators

- operation is order-sensitive but grouping is not identity-bearing;
- partitions are chosen by completion order;
- reduction silently changes output type without a declared accumulator schema;
- empty-set semantics are implicit.

---

## Chapter 40 — Pattern: Transactional Reservation and Settlement

### Intent

Prevent concurrent oversubscription of a countable resource and account honestly for ambiguous outcomes.

### Structure

```text
limit = used + reserved + available
admission: available -> reserved
success: reserved -> used + released remainder
known pre-execution failure: reserved -> available
ambiguous failure: reserved -> conservative used
```

### Forces

- concurrent workers race for the same quota;
- actual use is known only after execution;
- failed work may still incur cost;
- external providers report integer usage;
- policy may block, fail, or request approval.

### Consequences

- no double admission;
- explicit uncertainty policy;
- per-attempt accounting;
- operator-visible remaining budget.

Costs include detailed transition logic and conservative overcharging.

### Misuse indicators

- usage is decremented after the call without prior reservation;
- floating point is used for monetary authority;
- ambiguous outcomes are silently released;
- budget changes are unversioned;
- one reservation spans multiple independent attempts.

---

## Chapter 41 — Pattern: Capability-Oriented Host Modules

### Intent

Provide tasks with only the operations they need, under host-owned policy.

### Structure

```text
task declares alias
catalog pins alias list
registry advertises exact aliases
runtime constructs lease-scoped capability
capability validates every call
```

### Forces

- embedded languages otherwise inherit ambient process power;
- credentials and connections are host-owned;
- network, database, and execution policy must be bounded;
- operations need durable evidence.

### Consequences

- least privilege;
- capability-specific validation;
- easier privacy review;
- clear distinction between descriptor and authority.

Costs include many module factories and composition complexity.

### Misuse indicators

- aliases are names without implementation/policy identity;
- a generic `system` module exposes filesystem, network, env, and process APIs;
- task code selects credential sources;
- modules retain lease workspace paths after execution;
- the declared module list is not part of plan identity.

---

## Chapter 42 — Pattern: Privileged Parent, Sandboxed Child

### Intent

Run less-trusted code without granting it durable state or publication authority.

### Structure

```text
parent stages immutable inputs and bundle
parent starts constrained child
child computes into private output root
child returns bounded canonical manifest
parent verifies bytes, paths, schemas, and identity
parent publishes under current lease fence
```

### Forces

- task code may need process execution;
- arbitrary code should not access control database;
- output claims are untrusted;
- cancellation must terminate descendants;
- executor identity must be pinned.

### Consequences

- strong containment;
- narrow protocol;
- parent retains final authority;
- malicious or buggy child cannot directly corrupt workflow state.

Costs include OS-specific machinery, extra staging, and protocol maintenance.

### Misuse indicators

- child can access artifact-store credentials directly;
- child response is trusted without filesystem verification;
- sandbox policy is not part of plan identity;
- only the direct process is killed, leaving descendants;
- host environment is inherited.

---

## Chapter 43 — Pattern: Deterministic Projection over Authority

### Intent

Create metrics and read models that can be regenerated from source records.

### Structure

```text
stable source snapshot
 -> canonical ordering
 -> source digest
 -> versioned pure derivation
 -> result digest
 -> explicit coverage
```

### Forces

- mutable counters drift;
- semantics evolve;
- evidence must be reproducible;
- raw source is too detailed for every consumer;
- missing boundaries must remain visible.

### Consequences

- projections are disposable;
- regressions can be detected by digest;
- old source can be reprojected with a new version;
- users can audit coverage.

Costs include snapshot size and projector-version management.

### Misuse indicators

- projector reads changing state without a transaction;
- missing data is replaced with zero;
- source digest excludes relevant rows;
- projection writes back as a competing mutable authority;
- derivation version is absent.

---

## Chapter 44 — Pattern: Anti-Corruption Bridge

### Intent

Integrate two systems while preserving each system’s vocabulary and authority.

### Structure

```text
System A contract
 -> strict bridge input
 -> semantic translation
 -> System B occurrence
 -> lineage
 -> translated terminal evidence
```

### Forces

- systems have different run and retry semantics;
- direct package imports create coupling;
- external protocols need independent versioning;
- cancellation and artifacts cross process boundaries;
- neither system should become a second authority for the other.

### Consequences

- local models remain coherent;
- version mismatches fail explicitly;
- lineage is first-class;
- integration can be replaced independently.

Costs include duplicated wire types and contract tests.

### Misuse indicators

- bridge equates concepts that only look similar;
- implementation structs are shared as wire contracts;
- retries are silently adopted across systems;
- artifact bytes are copied without custody policy;
- bridge errors leak domain-specific free text into generic evidence.

---

## Chapter 45 — Pattern: Mutable Builder, Immutable Product

### Intent

Allow convenient assembly while guaranteeing stable concurrent use.

### Instances in Workflow V3

- JavaScript builder → `WorkflowIR`;
- compiler → `WorkflowPlan`;
- `RegistryBuilder` → `SealedRegistry`;
- temporary artifact → content-addressed object;
- sandbox output → verified artifact;
- source snapshot → immutable observation set.

### Structure

```text
private mutable state
 -> validation
 -> canonicalization
 -> freeze/copy
 -> digest
 -> publish immutable value
```

### Forces

- construction naturally needs mutation;
- runtime values are shared across goroutines;
- identity requires fixed bytes;
- rollback is easier before publication;
- readers should not coordinate with writers.

### Consequences

- simpler concurrency;
- stable identity;
- clear lifecycle transition;
- safe caching.

Costs include copying and builder/product duplication.

### Misuse indicators

- frozen values expose mutable maps or slices without cloning;
- digest is computed before normalization;
- builder can mutate the product after sealing;
- publication occurs before validation.

---

## Chapter 46 — Pattern: Boundedness as an Architectural Primitive

### Intent

Make resource and data limits part of contracts rather than operational afterthoughts.

### Bounded dimensions in the codebase

- protocol bytes;
- artifact bytes;
- output file count;
- task process count;
- wall and CPU time;
- memory;
- map item count;
- materialization lead;
- reduction levels and fan-in;
- external operations per attempt;
- counters per descriptor;
- error message length;
- HTTP response size;
- tool argument count and length;
- observation record counts;
- critical-path entries;
- API page limits.

### Why limits belong in identity

Some limits affect only safety. Others affect results. A reduction fan-in can change floating-point output. A timeout changes which result exists. A max-response limit may truncate or fail an operation.

The architecture should classify each bound as:

- safety-only host bound;
- compiled execution policy;
- scientific treatment or result-affecting parameter.

### Misuse indicators

- `0` ambiguously means unlimited or default;
- limits are local constants not reflected in plans;
- child and parent enforce different bounds;
- a limit failure has no stable code;
- bounds can be raised by untrusted task code.

---

## Chapter 47 — Pattern: Closed Failure Vocabulary

### Intent

Make failure behavior machine-readable, privacy-safe, and stable across implementations.

### Structure

```go
type Failure struct {
    Class     string
    Code      string
    Retryable bool
    Message   string // bounded diagnostic
}
```

### Forces

- retry decisions require classification;
- provider text may contain secrets;
- aggregate observations need stable categories;
- cross-process and cross-repository contracts need bounded data;
- operators still need some diagnosis.

### Consequences

- failure logic avoids string matching;
- exports remain compact;
- metrics can group by class/code;
- arbitrary provider errors do not enter the ledger.

Costs include maintaining a taxonomy and mapping low-level errors.

### Misuse indicators

- every implementation invents codes without registry or documentation;
- `Retryable` contradicts code semantics;
- all failures become `internal`;
- useful causal chains disappear entirely;
- message becomes the real machine-readable field again.

# Part VII — Critical Appraisal and Architectural Refactoring

## Chapter 48 — Where the Modularity Works Exceptionally Well

Workflow V3 is strongest where it separates identities and authorities that are commonly collapsed.

### Authoring is not execution

The JavaScript program disappears after compilation. Runtime recovery does not need to rerun authoring callbacks. This is a clean compiler boundary.

### Logical task is not implementation bytes

`TaskKey` and `ImplementationIdentity` separate semantic naming from exact code. This supports compatibility discussion without sacrificing reproducibility.

### Plan is not run

The plan is immutable evidence. The run is a mutable occurrence referencing it.

### Node is not attempt

A node represents logical work. Attempts represent acquisitions and retries. This is one of the most important distinctions in any durable executor.

### Artifact reference is not artifact bytes

Control state remains compact and byte integrity is independently verifiable.

### Effect admission is not effect completion

External calls can remain honestly uncertain after a crash.

### Operational state is not observation

The terminal observation set is derived and versioned rather than maintained as mutable counters.

### Security policy is not runtime convention

Isolation policy, module aliases, and executor identity are compiled and verified.

### Human waiting is not worker execution

Gates wait without leases.

These distinctions create composability because each mechanism can evolve within its authority. They also create a vocabulary suitable for teaching. Much of software architecture is the art of refusing to use one record for two meanings.

### Small interfaces at the right boundaries

The AST analysis found eight interfaces with four methods or fewer. The most valuable are:

```go
ArtifactStore
ExternalOperationRecorder
RegistryResolver
Source
IsolatedTaskExecutor
DomainProjector
TaskPackageModuleProvider
```

Each names a meaningful authority boundary. The interfaces are not generic `Repository[T]` abstractions; their methods express domain operations.

### Tests align with invariants

The test design reinforces the architecture through restart, race, privacy, and real process-boundary tests. This is a sign that the abstractions are not merely aesthetic.

---

## Chapter 49 — Where the Abstractions Leak

No modular system is perfectly sealed. The leaks reveal where the architecture is still a product-specific implementation rather than a reusable kernel.

### Runtime imports concrete SQLite

`Engine.Store` is a concrete `*workflowv3sqlite.Store`. This couples orchestration to one persistence implementation and lets runtime code depend on a broad store surface.

A refactoring should not begin with a giant interface. Instead, identify transactional capabilities:

```go
type LeaseStore interface {
    LeaseNextWithResources(...) (*Lease, error)
    ResolveInputs(...) (..., error)
    CompleteWithUsage(...) error
    Fail(...) error
    RenewLease(...) (bool, error)
    LeaseValid(...) (bool, error)
}

type GraphStore interface {
    ExpansionCandidates(...) (..., error)
    ExpandNextPage(...) (..., error)
    ReductionCandidates(...) (..., error)
    // ...
}
```

Then evaluate whether the split reflects real substitute implementations or only makes tests easier.

### SQLite imports observation types

The persistence adapter returns `workflowv3observations.SourceSnapshot`. This makes the store aware of a downstream read-model package.

Possible alternatives:

- define source snapshot contracts in the core package;
- let the observation package own SQL queries through a narrow query port;
- introduce a neutral `workflowrecord` package;
- accept the dependency because the snapshot is an adapter result.

Each option shifts coupling rather than eliminating it.

### Product composition is package-catalog specific

`workflowv3product` knows built-in packages and module factories. A general executor would separate package discovery, trust policy, installation, and runtime composition.

### Host modules have incomplete identity

Task bundles and restricted executors are digest-pinned. Trusted native module behavior is represented primarily by alias. A host binary or configuration change can alter semantics behind the same alias.

### Read APIs expose internal snapshot shapes

`RunView` combines a core snapshot with a large operational snapshot. This is convenient but can make external API compatibility depend on internal fields.

### Researchrunner copies bytes

The integration boundary undermines the internal artifact-reference architecture by reading outputs and embedding bytes in frames.

### Lesson: abstraction integrity must be end-to-end

A content-addressed internal design does not help if the outermost bridge returns to inline byte payloads. A policy compiler does not provide reproducibility if a host capability changes behind an unchanged alias. Review boundaries across the whole path.

## Chapter 50 — Recognizing Overengineering

The codebase contains sophisticated mechanisms because real incidents demanded them. The same mechanisms can become overengineering when generalized beyond their use cases.

### The feature cross-product

A new node kind can interact with:

- static dependencies;
- maps;
- reductions;
- gates;
- budgets;
- resource classes;
- registry generations;
- trusted modules;
- restricted isolation;
- retries;
- external operations;
- observations;
- Researchctl export.

Each additional first-class mechanism multiplies test combinations.

### Special forms in the IR

Static nodes, maps, reductions, and gates are distinct arrays and database tables. This gives each mechanism precise semantics, but the compiler and runtime must handle them separately.

A more uniform graph model could encode orchestration nodes as typed internal operators. That may reduce duplicated plumbing but make validation and SQL harder.

### Rolling registry generations

Draining and quarantine are valuable in a long-lived multi-tenant worker service. They may be unnecessary in a local one-shot scientific executor. Complexity should match deployment mode.

### Transactional budgets and gates

Budget reservation, settlement, operator increases, and approval activation are excellent for expensive providers. They are substantial machinery for ordinary file workflows.

A modular product could make them optional runtime extensions rather than mandatory concepts in every plan schema.

### JavaScript DSL plus embedded task packages

The user gets a dynamic workflow syntax but cannot freely define dynamic task implementations. The result combines the complexity of an embedded language with the deployment model of a statically linked appliance.

This is the clearest candidate for simplification.

### The overengineering test

Ask five questions:

1. Does the feature protect an invariant or merely provide convenience?
2. Is the invariant universal to the kernel or specific to one domain?
3. Can the feature be represented as an adapter or policy module?
4. How many representations and state machines must change?
5. Is there a smaller established tool that already solves it?

A feature that is domain-specific, cross-cutting, and weakly used should probably remain outside the core.

## Chapter 51 — Missing Mechanisms for a General Scientific Executor

Workflow V3 is a capable durable runtime, but several needs remain outside its current abstraction.

### Cross-run materialization cache

The executor has content-addressed artifacts but no first-class global step cache keyed by:

- implementation identity;
- exact inputs;
- parameters;
- environment;
- relevant resource/hardware class;
- external provider identity;
- reproducibility policy.

Without this, a RAG experiment matrix may recompute chunking, summaries, embeddings, and indexes for every case.

### Streaming and large artifact support

The byte-slice artifact API and small bridge limits cannot handle large scientific data. Required capabilities include:

- streaming readers and writers;
- multipart remote storage;
- artifact trees;
- sharded datasets;
- server-side copy;
- checksum verification without full memory buffering;
- resumable transfer.

### Environment identity

The system pins task bundle bytes and restricted executor binaries, but not a complete general environment:

- container image digest;
- dependency lock;
- native libraries;
- CUDA and driver versions;
- locale and timezone;
- model assets;
- host module implementation;
- hardware facts.

### Rich resource scheduling

Named capacity classes do not fully model:

- CPU cores;
- RAM;
- GPU count and model;
- GPU memory;
- local disk;
- network locality;
- exclusive devices;
- topology and affinity.

### General command and container tasks

A scientific executor needs ordinary Python, R, Julia, shell-free command arrays, and OCI containers. Task registration should not require embedding JavaScript into Go source.

### Logs and diagnostics

The privacy-safe standard evidence is good, but users need policy-controlled stdout, stderr, structured logs, and debug artifacts.

### Conditional flow and branch ownership

The gate design exposes the absence of explicit branch semantics. A broader workflow language needs conditional outputs, skipped states, branch cancellation, and joins.

### Distributed service mode

SQLite coordinates local processes. A shared service may need PostgreSQL, remote workers, authentication, leases across hosts, and remote artifact storage.

### Provenance export

The executor should emit a complete terminal execution manifest with every step, attempt, input, output, effect, environment, and derivation edge. Higher-level systems can then import it without scraping internal database state.

---

## Chapter 52 — A Fundamental Shift in Scripting Patterns

The most important redesign is not another DSL feature. It is changing what scripts are responsible for.

### Current pattern

```text
Go package embeds CommonJS task bytes
Go package registers descriptors and native modules
JavaScript workflow composes those descriptors
Goja executes tasks or launches a static isolated Goja worker
```

This is controlled, but it makes task development a framework-internal activity.

### Proposed pattern

```text
canonical plan data
    |
    +-- optional Python/TypeScript/YAML authoring
    |
    v
language-neutral execution plan
    |
    +-- command task
    +-- container task
    +-- native trusted task
    +-- remote service task
    |
    v
file/object-store task protocol
```

### Task descriptor

```yaml
kind: command
identity:
  sourceDigest: sha256:...
  environment:
    image: ghcr.io/example/rag-chunk@sha256:...
command:
  argv: [python, -m, rag_tasks.chunk]
inputs:
  corpus: rag/corpus-snapshot/v1
outputs:
  chunks: rag/chunk-set/v1
resources:
  cpu: 4
  memoryBytes: 8589934592
network:
  mode: none
retry:
  maxAttempts: 2
```

### File-based attempt contract

```text
attempt/
  request.json
  inputs/
  work/
  outputs/
  result.json
  logs/
  telemetry/
```

The worker writes files and one terminal manifest. The parent verifies and publishes.

### Why ordinary scripts matter

Scientists already use:

- Python packages;
- notebooks converted to scripts;
- R analysis;
- command-line tools;
- model servers;
- container images.

The executor should capture and constrain those tools, not require them to be rewritten into a custom JavaScript task ABI.

### Keep the good compiler boundary

The shift does not discard IR and plan compilation. It changes task implementation and authoring adapters.

```text
Python builder / YAML / JS
       -> same canonical IR
       -> same policy compiler
       -> same durable runtime kernel
```

### Keep native tasks for trusted infrastructure

Some operations benefit from in-process Go implementations: store maintenance, projection, small transforms, or tightly controlled adapters. They should be one backend, not the universal task model.

---

## Chapter 53 — Refactoring Toward a Reusable Executor Kernel

A clean extraction can proceed in stages.

### Stage 1: define the kernel boundary

The kernel owns:

- plan identity;
- logical nodes;
- attempts;
- lease and cancellation fencing;
- resource admission;
- retry deadlines;
- artifact references;
- terminal state;
- generic effect evidence;
- deterministic execution manifest.

The kernel does not own:

- JavaScript authoring;
- RAG semantics;
- Researchctl schemas;
- built-in task packages;
- HTTP operator presentation;
- statistical analysis.

### Stage 2: split runtime ports

Candidate ports:

```go
type ExecutionStore interface {
    SubmitRun(...)
    LeaseNext(...)
    ResolveInputs(...)
    Complete(...)
    Fail(...)
    Renew(...)
    Cancel(...)
    Snapshot(...)
}

type ArtifactStore interface { /* streaming API */ }

type ExecutorBackend interface {
    Identity() BackendIdentity
    Supports(TaskPlan) error
    Execute(context.Context, AttemptRequest) (CandidateResult, error)
}

type EffectRecorder interface { /* current admission protocol */ }
```

### Stage 3: represent orchestration operators uniformly

Maps, reductions, and gates can remain first-class, but their compiled forms should implement one internal orchestration interface or state transition protocol. This can reduce dispatcher branching while preserving specialized storage.

### Stage 4: add execution fingerprints and cache records

```go
type ExecutionFingerprint struct {
    TaskIdentity      string
    EnvironmentDigest string
    Inputs            []ArtifactRef
    ParametersDigest  string
    ResourceClass     string
    Reproducibility   string
}

type CacheRecord struct {
    Fingerprint string
    Outputs     map[string]ArtifactRef
    ProducerRun RunID
    VerifiedAt  time.Time
}
```

A cache hit creates a new step occurrence linked to the producer; it does not erase scientific occurrence identity.

### Stage 5: separate local and service products

```text
executor-local
  SQLite + filesystem CAS + local/container backends

executor-service
  PostgreSQL + object store + remote workers + auth
```

Both consume the same canonical plan.

### Stage 6: make authoring replaceable

Provide:

- YAML/JSON schema;
- Python SDK;
- TypeScript SDK;
- optional existing Goja frontend;
- direct Go builder for tests and embedded use.

### Stage 7: emit a complete terminal manifest

The terminal manifest should include:

- plan and run identities;
- node and attempt records;
- exact task/environment identities;
- all artifact edges;
- cache dispositions;
- external effects and accounting;
- resource placement;
- logs and diagnostic references;
- coverage and terminal status.

Researchctl should import this manifest as retrospective provenance.

---

## Chapter 54 — Lessons for Future Modular Systems

The codebase yields several broad lessons.

### 1. Distinctions are the raw material of architecture

Plan versus run, node versus attempt, artifact versus reference, admission versus completion, requested versus effective, source versus projection. Each distinction prevents a category error.

### 2. Interfaces should name authority

`ArtifactStore` and `ExternalOperationRecorder` are useful because they name coherent authority. An interface that merely mirrors a large concrete store is less valuable.

### 3. Immutability needs a publication boundary

Immutable values do not emerge by convention. They are assembled privately, validated, normalized, digested, and published.

### 4. Concurrency correctness belongs in storage transitions

A mutex in one worker process cannot protect cross-process leases, budgets, or gates. The transaction is the concurrency boundary.

### 5. Cancellation without fencing is advisory

Always separate stopping work from rejecting obsolete results.

### 6. Boundedness is part of the type system

Maximum bytes, items, attempts, levels, processes, and calls should be explicit in contracts.

### 7. Observability should not become another authority

Derive standard metrics from source facts and record coverage.

### 8. Security and reproducibility overlap but differ

A sandbox may be secure without recording a reproducible environment. A content digest may support reproducibility without granting safe execution.

### 9. Recovery semantics should drive the model

If a system cannot explain what happens after a crash between every two steps, its abstractions are incomplete.

### 10. A prototype can be both overbuilt and deeply valuable

Workflow V3 contains more machinery than many products need. That machinery captures real design knowledge. The task is not to copy it wholesale. The task is to extract the invariants, preserve the patterns, and simplify the product surface.

## Textbook scope

The book contains approximately **32,300 words across 8,089 lines**, organized into:

- **60 chapters**
- **10 implementation laboratories**
- **6 appendices**
- **586 fenced code-block markers**
- API and type-signature atlases
- Mermaid component, lifecycle, state-machine, and dataflow diagrams
- Review questions and design exercises throughout
- A capstone project specification

The course proceeds from the concrete Workflow V3 codebase to a reusable pattern language:

1. **Reading the architecture**  
   Package boundaries, dependency direction, control/data/authority/evidence planes, and the progression from JavaScript authoring to a durable occurrence.

2. **The immutable core**  
   Canonical values, content-derived identities, artifact references, task contracts, bundles, catalogs, sealed registries, policy compilation, and the JavaScript DSL as a compiler front-end.

3. **Durable runtime mechanics**  
   Runs, nodes, attempts, leases, atomic admission, fencing tokens, cancellation epochs, work-conserving dispatch, retry debt, registry generations, lazy maps, bounded reductions, approval gates, budgets, external operations, and parent-controlled publication.

4. **Capabilities and isolation**  
   Explicit authority, selected host modules, trusted versus restricted execution, Bubblewrap, cgroup v2, exact executor identity, child-protocol validation, and privacy through structural exclusion.

5. **Evidence and projections**  
   Source snapshots, deterministic projections, coverage, interval algebra, critical paths, Researchctl integration, and the product package as composition root.

6. **Reusable design patterns**  
   Functional core and imperative shell, ports and adapters, compiler IRs, identity composition, durable state machines, object capabilities, idempotency, boundedness, CQRS-like projections, immutable generations, migration policy, and complexity-budget review.

7. **RAG research case study**  
   The architecture is applied to chunking, enrichment, embeddings, lexical and vector indexes, retrieval, reranking, context construction, answer generation, and evaluation. This section also derives the missing cross-run materialization cache, streaming artifact API, language-neutral task model, and portable execution manifest.

8. **Laboratories**  
   Students build AST scanners, artifact-store adapters, alternate compiler front-ends, state-machine analyzers, fencing tests, dispatchers, lazy maps, reductions, budget ledgers, isolated executors, and evidence projectors.

## Analysis companion

The companion contains two custom, dependency-free Go analysis tools:

### `archscan`

Built with `go/parser`, `go/ast`, `go/token`, and `go/printer`. It extracts:

- package dependencies;
- type and API signatures;
- interface method sets;
- constructors, validators, compilers, resolvers, and lifecycle functions;
- concurrency constructs;
- transaction, filesystem, process, network, serialization, and identity-related calls;
- syntax-based candidate interface implementations;
- Markdown or JSON architecture reports.

### `statescan`

Analyzes the SQLite schema and Go SQL literals to extract:

- tables and columns;
- primary and foreign keys;
- status enumerations;
- state assignments in Go functions;
- capability, fencing, epoch, version, generation, policy, and expiry columns;
- reviewed legal state transitions;
- Mermaid state-machine and relationship diagrams.

The companion also includes:

- curated architecture and state atlases;
- the reviewed transition manifest;
- rerun instructions;
- analysis limitations;
- SHA-256 manifests.

Both tools compile under the available Go environment, `go test ./...` passes, their smoke tests succeeded, and both ZIP archives passed integrity verification.
