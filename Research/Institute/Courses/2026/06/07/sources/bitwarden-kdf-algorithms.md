Bitwarden first uses Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) on account creation to derive a master key for the account from 
the input master password, which acts as input for a master password hash for the account ([learn 
more](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/#overview-of-the-master-password-hashing,-key-derivation
,-and-encryption-process)). Whenever a user is authenticated, for example when unlocking a vault or satisfying master 
password re-prompt, the process is repeated so that the newly-derived hash can be compared to the originally-derived 
hash. If they match, the user is authenticated.

KDFs are used in this capacity to frustrate brute-force or dictionary attacks against a master password. KDFs force an 
attacker's machines to compute a non-trivial number of hashes for each password guess, at increasing cost to the 
attacker.

Two KDF algorithms are currently available for use in Bitwarden for password derivation; [PBKDF2](#pbkdf2) and 
[Argon2](#argon2id). Each algorithm has a selection of options available which can be used to increase the time and 
expense, or "work factor", imposed on the attacker.

## PBKDF2

Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) is [recommended by 
NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecretver) and, as implemented by Bitwarden, satisfies FIPS-140 
requirements so long as default values are not changed.

PBKDF2, as implemented by Bitwarden, works by salting your master password with your username and running the resultant 
value through a one-way hash algorithm (HMAC-SHA-256) to create a fixed-length hash. This value is again salted with 
your username and hashed a configurable number of times (**KDF iterations**). The resultant value after all iterations 
is your master key, which acts as input for the master password hash used to authenticate that user whenever they log 
in ([learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/#hashing-key-derivation-and-encryption)).



##### note

Bitwarden performs additional iterations beyond what is configured between the client and the server. The master 
password hash has a total default of 700,000 iterations. See the [Bitwarden Security 
Whitepaper](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/) for more details.

By default, Bitwarden is set to iterate 600,000 times, as [recommended by 
OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2) for HMAC-SHA-256 
implementations. As long as the user does not set this value lower, the implementation is FIPS-140 compliant.

## Argon2id

Argon2 is the winner of the 2015 [Password Hashing Competition](https://www.password-hashing.net/), is available as an 
alternative to [PBKDF2.](#pbkdf2) There are three versions of the algorithm, and Bitwarden has implemented Argon2id [as 
recommended by OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html). Argon2id is a 
hybrid of other versions, using a combination of data-depending and data-independent memory accesses, which gives it 
some of Argon2i's resistance to side-channel cache timing attacks and much of Argon2d's resistance to GPU cracking 
attacks ([source](https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2)).

Argon2, as implemented by Bitwarden, works by salting your master password with your username and running the resultant 
value through a one-way hash algorithm (BLAKE2b) to create a fixed-length hash.

Argon2 then allocates a portion of memory (**KDF memory**) and fills it with the computed hash until full. This is 
repeated, starting in the subsequent portion of memory where it left off in the first, a number of times iteratively 
(**KDF iterations**) across a number of threads (**KDF parallelism**). The resultant value after all iterations, is 
your master key, which acts as input for the master password hash used to authenticate that user whenever they log in 
([learn more](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/#hashing-key-derivation-and-encryption)).

By default, Bitwarden is set to allocate 64 MiB of memory, iterate over it 3 times, and do so across 4 threads. These 
defaults are above [current OWASP 
recommendations](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction), but 
here are some tips should you choose to change your settings:

- Increasing **KDF iterations** will increase running time linearly.
- The amount of **KDF parallelism** you can use depends on your machine's CPU. Generally, Max. Parallelism = Num. of 
Cores x 2.

##### note

Argon2id users with a KDF memory value higher than 64 MiB will receive a warning dialogue every time iOS autofill is 
initiated or a new Send is created through the Share sheet. To avoid this message, adjust Argon2id settings or enable 
[unlock with biometrics](https://bitwarden.com/help/biometrics/#set-up-biometrics-for-mobile).

## Changing KDF algorithms

Changing the iteration count can help protect your master password from being brute forced by an attacker, however 
should not be viewed as a substitute to using a strong master password in the first place. A strong master password is 
always the first and best line of defense for your Bitwarden account.

Changing the KDF algorithm re-encrypts the protected symmetric key and updates the authentication hash, much like a 
normal master password change. The [symmetric encryption 
key](https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/#rotating-the-account-encryption-key) is not rotated, 
however, so vault data is not re-encrypted. Learn more about [re-encrypting your 
data](https://bitwarden.com/help/account-encryption-key/#rotate-your-encryption-key).



##### note

Backing up your vault data is not required before changing your encryption settings, however taking regular backups is 
highly recommended.

To update your KDF algorithm:

1. In the web app, go to **Settings** → **Security**.
2. Select **Keys**: *Encryption key settings (image unavailable)*
3. From the **Algorithm** dropdown menu, select **PBKDF2 SHA-256** or **Argon2id**.
4. (Optional) Update the additional settings that appear.
5. Select **Update encryption settings**.

More KDF iterations will increase both the time it will take an attacker to crack a password **and** the time it will 
take a legitimate user to log in. Setting your KDF iterations too high could result in slower performance when logging 
into and unlocking Bitwarden on devices with slower CPUs. We recommend increasing the value in increments of 100,000 
and then testing on all of your devices.

For **PBKDF2 SHA-256**, the default KDF iteration setting is 600,000.

For **Argon2id**, the default settings are:

- KDF memory: 32
- KDF iterations: 6
- KDF parallelism: 4

### Low PBKDF2 KDF iterations

In the [2026.2.1 release](https://bitwarden.com/help/releasenotes/#2026-2-1), Bitwarden increased the minimum number of 
PBKDF2 KDF iterations to the default level, 600,000, in accordance with OWASP guidelines. This strengthens vault 
encryption against hackers armed with increasingly powerful devices.

If you use the PBKDF2 algorithm and the KDF iterations are set below 600,000, you may see a message to **Update your 
encryption settings**. If you see this message, enter your master password and select **Update settings** to increase 
your KDF iterations to 600,000. You will not need to re-log into any clients for the change to occur. If you instead 
click **Later**, this message will appear again after 24 hours to encourage you to protect your account. Alternatively 
for your convenience, you will not see the prompt and the increase will happen automatically if you unlock or log in 
with your master password.

### HKDF

HKDF is a HMAC-based KDF specified in [RFC 5869](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869) that is widely used in 
the industry and recommended by NIST in [SP 
800-56](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-56Cr2.pdf). Bitwarden uses HKDF in order to 
derive encryption keys from non-password material, such as other keys or cryptographically randomly generated material.
