# Architecture Garden — dropcut-studio

`dropcut-studio` is a TypeScript CAM monorepo with a nested Go controller
(`makera-z1-cli`) that commands a Makera Z1 CNC machine over a single TCP
connection. This Garden project studies the **communication / command-control
protocol** between the Go controller (`z1ctl`) and the machine firmware — not
the CAM compiler, the JavaScript scripting host, or the machining certificate,
which are covered by the repository's own docmgr tickets (MZ1-004 and the CAM
series).

The controller is better structured than a typical ad hoc CNC client: typed
motion operations, an explicit risk-class ladder, a no-retry rule for motion,
fresh preflight, a dead-man jog, and loopback-first web posture are all sound.
The reusable pattern documented here is the one that sits underneath all of
those and that is the most broadly portable to other command-control line
protocols: how a host that does **not** own a device's output stream still
delimits and correlates per-command replies.

> [!summary]
> - The controller speaks a framed binary protocol to the machine and uses an
>   **injected sentinel** (`echo \x04`) to mark the end of each command's
>   output, relying on the firmware's ordered line queue.
> - The pattern is portable to any command-control line protocol where the
>   host cannot frame the peer's replies directly (embedded serial shells,
>   GRBL/Smoothieware-derived firmware, U-Boot, Expect-style automation).
> - Its correctness hinges on one distinction: a **constant sentinel is a
>   delimiter, not a correlation identifier**. A correct design correlates by
>   value (a per-command nonce) or quarantines the session on any ambiguous
>   timeout — it never treats a timed-out exchange as silently resumable.

## Design entries

- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/designs/04 - First-Class Session with Typed State Machine, Unique Correlation, and Quarantine Recovery|04 — First-Class Session: Typed State Machine, Unique Correlation, Quarantine Recovery]] *(overarching pattern — the session skeleton; the entries below are its facets)*
- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/designs/01 - Sentinel-Delimited Command Completion over an Ordered Line Queue|01 — Sentinel-Delimited Command Completion over an Ordered Line Queue]] *(facet: correlation / identity)*
- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/designs/02 - Latched Safety Channel over a Lossy Inbound Queue|02 — Latched Safety Channel over a Lossy Inbound Queue]] *(facet: safety delivery / observability)*
- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/designs/03 - Dead-Man Keepalive - Fail-Safe Motion by Causal Inversion|03 — Dead-Man Keepalive: Fail-Safe Motion by Causal Inversion]] *(facet: fail-safe action)*

### Implementation-derived entries added 2026-09-13

- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/designs/06 - Consecutive Evidence Observer - Completion Without Owning the Operation|06 — Consecutive Evidence Observer]] — a domain-classified reducer for consecutive completion evidence, independent of polling and transport.
- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/designs/07 - Browser Intent Ownership - Confirm Once and Renew Only While Held|07 — Browser Intent Ownership]] — one-shot confirmation and held-gesture lifecycles outside React, with stale-response fencing and explicit cleanup limits.

These entries describe commits `a5faea1` and `8b8d947`; they do not replace the historical analysis above or establish new hardware acceptance.

### Bounded observation and subscription pattern added 2026-09-13

- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/designs/08 - Bounded Cursor Broadcast - Independent Readers with Explicit Gaps|08 — Bounded Cursor Broadcast: Independent Readers with Explicit Gaps]] — one bounded shared history, independent reader cursors, explicit retention loss, snapshot-to-subscription continuity and cancellation independent of machine operations.

Updated after implementation commit `be7c744`: the entry now documents the concrete
`pkg/broadcast.Buffer[T]` API and all three integrations—protocol observations,
controller snapshots/subscriptions and the legacy diagnostic message journal.
The shared extraction is implemented and its focused race tests and vet pass. The pattern
requires neither a message broker nor a lossless journal. Earlier entries remain
historical analyses, not a claim that old grant/dead-man proposals are current
stock-firmware capabilities or current P3 requirements.

### Controller ownership and evidence separation added 2026-09-13

- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/designs/09 - Single-Owner CNC Controller - Worker Ownership Separate from Operation Evidence|09 — Single-Owner CNC Controller: Worker Ownership Separate from Operation Evidence]] — the actual controller architecture, two identified command/review slots, concrete evidence checks, cancellation/reconciliation behavior and a deliberate complexity budget. Implemented cleanup at `da0d33d`; broader P3 and production cutover remain incomplete.

## Proposals

- [[Research/Software Architecture Garden/dropcut-studio/proposals/01-z1-communication-api-design-and-implementation-guide|01 — Z1 Communication API: Design and Implementation Guide (Intern Edition)]] — a concrete `pkg/z1session` API design realizing designs 01–04 above.

## Source provenance

The detailed study behind this Garden project is a docmgr ticket, `MZ1-005`,
authored in the source repository's `ttmp/` tree (branch `task/cnc-control-
dropcut`, local commit `5f33ba1`, not yet pushed at analysis time). The Garden
entry is the cross-project distillation; the ticket is the full evidence-led
investigation. Where they disagree, the ticket has the deeper line-anchored
evidence and the Garden entry has the portable abstraction.
